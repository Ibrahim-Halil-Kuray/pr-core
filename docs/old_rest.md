# Remaining Useful Information

The Proxeus Project
===================

Blockchain technology creates new framework conditions allowing innovative business models to emerge. Yet a lot of blockchain ideas stay stuck in the heads of entrepreneurs because the technological and financial barriers to create them are too high. Web development has seen a “no code” revolution over the last decade, with new tools - such as WordPress - leading to the creation of a lot of value for society at large. We want to make Proxeus the Wordpress of blockchain and democratize the development of blockchain applications.

Proxeus makes blockchain accessible by simplifying the creation of document-centered blockchain applications, allowing users to digitize and run their processes in a decentralized environment. In essence, the framework can be seen as a bridge connecting two worlds and allowing on the one hand individuals and businesses to digitize traditional processes and register information on a blockchain, and on the other one to make blockchain activity visible by generating human-readable documents.

Over the past two years, we worked with industry partners on projects using the Proxeus technology stack in various contexts: from speeding up the incorporation of Swiss companies to tokenizing a supercar, demonstrating a track-and-trace solution for the logistics space, making university diplomas tamper-proof or improving anti-doping processes. This inflow of requirements based on concrete user needs constituted an important help for concretizing the architecture, scope and functionalities of the solution. Several of those initiatives received international recognition and media coverage, creating global awareness for Proxeus and inspiring community members to prototype and test their own ideas.

FAQ
===

1. What is Proxeus?

Often dubbed as the “Wordpress of blockchain”, Proxeus is a tool aiming to simplify the development of document-centered blockchain applications.

2. What use cases can be built with the product?

The set up features and functionalities offered allows to quickly prototype a large range of blockchain applications. Have a look at use cases we have been working on over the last years in the “discover” section for some inspiration.

3. What is the role of the XES token in the overall framework?

XES is the utility token used to facilitate transactions across the Proxeus ecosystem. Workflow creators can decide to make their work available externally, for free or for a fee. Workflows published on a platform can be purchased by consumers on a pay-per-use basis.

4. How can I use the application?

If you are interested to test the Proxeus platform, a demo application with limited functionalities is available on testnet.
If you are a developer and would like to install Proxeus, please check the developer section of the website.

5. How can I get started on the test platform?

The following apps are needed to use Proxeus.

_Google Chrome_

We recommend using the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Other MetaMask- compatible browsers may work, too.

_MetaMask_

MetaMask is required for processing your payments for our services. Proxeus also allows you to log in using your Ethereum wallet instead of a password. You can download MetaMask directly from [here](https://metamask.io/).

_Document Editor_

Proxeus templates must be created in the OpenDocument Text format with the “.ODT” suffix. Several popular office suites such as Microsoft Word and the free-to-use LibreOffice and OpenOffice support this format. 

A free download can be found [here.](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)

‍

  

6. How do I receive test Ether and test XES?

Because the test platform runs on the Ropsten Test network, switch to the Ropsten testnet by opening MetaMask, clicking on “Main Ethereum Network” and selecting “Ropsten Test network”.

_Test Ether_

In order to obtain free test Ethers (ETH), you can use the Ropsten faucet. Open MetaMask and click “buy” (or “deposit” if you are using an Apple computer). Click on “Get Ether”, this should open a page that allows you to request as many test Ethers as possible. It may take up to a few minutes until the test Ethers show up in your balance in MetaMask.

_Test XES_

Every user receives 10 test XES upon registration on the platform.

To check your test XES balance, you need to add the token to your MetaMask wallet. In the “Tokens” tab, click “Add token” and use the following inputs:

*   Token Contract Address: 0x84e0b37e8f5b4b86d5d299b0b0e33686405a3919
*   Token Symbol: XES
*   Decimals of Precision: 18


7. hat’s the difference between Ethereum Mainnet and test networks?

The test networks for the Ethereum blockchain are an incredibly useful tool for easy and painless software testing. They are like cloned copies of the real blockchain, running on separate nodes. Ethers (ETH) in testnets do not carry any value and can be obtained for free from a so-called faucet. We use the Ropsten testnet as an inexpensive way to test our smart contracts and blockchain interactions. This means that you do not have to use your own Ethers (ETH) or Proxeus tokens (XES) for your testing activities. In fact, we strongly recommend using a separate wallet for testing purposes. In MetaMask, you can easily create as many wallets as you want and simply switch between them.  

8. Do I need to build a workflow in order to register documents on the blockchain?

The workflow builder allows anyone to define all the relevant information needed from the different parties involved in a particular process. The workflow builder contains three elements: templates, forms and conditions. With these three elements, it is possible to replicate complex workflows any other registration processes where inputs are required from several participants.

  

9.  What’s the technical concept behind the document registration process?

Proxeus calculates the unique fingerprint of your document, the so-called hash value, using the Keccak256 algorithm. Hashing is a one-way process, it’s impossible to figure out the content of a document based on the hash value. Proxeus registers only the hash value of the document in a smart contract on the public Ethereum blockchain. As hashing the same document always leads to the same hash value, this allows verifiers to compare their result with the value on the blockchain. We know Keccak as one of the most secure and efficient hashing algorithms - for more information, please consult a cryptography specialist.  

10.  Who can verify the authenticity of the created documents?

Anyone that is in possession of your created document and has access to the platform, can verify the authenticity of the document.

11.  Can I share my workflows with others?


Yes, workflows can be shared. However, the sharing feature is designed for experienced users who would like to collaborate with other users or publish their work for others to use or copy. More details can be found in the [handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/preview).

12.  Can other testers view/edit my workflows, forms and templates?


Unless you share your workflows, the workflows, templates and forms you create are only visible to you.

13.  Will my documents, workflows, templates and forms be saved if I log out?


Yes, all documents, workflows, templates and forms that you created will be saved on the server. However, please note that the data is wiped on a regular basis for privacy reasons - the schedule is published on the Proxeus website.

14.  Is there a bug bounty?


We are not running a bug bounty at the moment. With your valuable feedback, you are contributing to a project that will be open source and freely available to the community. If we run a bug bounty in the future, your contributions will be considered.  
  

15.  How can beta testers get personal support?


We’re kindly asking you to try and look for answers in this FAQ and the handbook first. If you’re stuck, a group of early users is happy to answer questions - get in touch using the @proxeusapp Twitter channel or via email (support@proxeus.com). Please keep in mind that the channel moderators work on a voluntary basis and do not provide 24/7 technical support.  

16.  Where can I report feature requests and bugs?


You can use the support@proxeus.com email to open improvement and bug tickets  

17.  Is Proxeus open source?

Yes, the Proxeus framework is published as open source software under a GNU GPLv3 license.

18. Where can I find detailed instructions about workflows, etc.?

We have prepared a user handbook [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/preview). It serves as a manual to all the available functionalities. We suggest reading the handbook from beginning to end and try out all the different features.
