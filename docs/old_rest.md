The Proxeus Project
===================

Blockchain technology creates new framework conditions allowing innovative business models to emerge. Yet a lot of blockchain ideas stay stuck in the heads of entrepreneurs because the technological and financial barriers to create them are too high. Web development has seen a “no code” revolution over the last decade, with new tools - such as WordPress - leading to the creation of a lot of value for society at large. We want to make Proxeus the Wordpress of blockchain and democratize the development of blockchain applications.

Proxeus makes blockchain accessible by simplifying the creation of document-centered blockchain applications, allowing users to digitize and run their processes in a decentralized environment. In essence, the framework can be seen as a bridge connecting two worlds and allowing on the one hand individuals and businesses to digitize traditional processes and register information on a blockchain, and on the other one to make blockchain activity visible by generating human-readable documents.

Over the past two years, we worked with industry partners on projects using the Proxeus technology stack in various contexts: from speeding up the incorporation of Swiss companies to tokenizing a supercar, demonstrating a track-and-trace solution for the logistics space, making university diplomas tamper-proof or improving anti-doping processes. This inflow of requirements based on concrete user needs constituted an important help for concretizing the architecture, scope and functionalities of the solution. Several of those initiatives received international recognition and media coverage, creating global awareness for Proxeus and inspiring community members to prototype and test their own ideas.
