_We are proud to announce that we have reached an important milestone: the Proxeus software has reached v1.1 and has been open sourced under a GNU GPLv3 license. Set up your own Proxeus instance and create your first application today!_

## ABOUT PROXEUS

Just like Wordpress empowered companies and enthusiasts to create websites without starting from a blank page at the beginning of the Internet, Proxeus aims to make blockchain technology more accessible by shortening the time necessary to create and test document-oriented use cases. The Proxeus software is a powerful workflow engine, allowing users without specific programming skills to digitize complex document templates, connect them to a business logic and make them available to third-parties on a web-based portal — for free or for a fee.

Since the [v1 release](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-v1-0-32144b628349) in September, several improvements have been made to implement the community feedback, as well as the recommendations received through a series of product, technical, legal and security audit rounds. The application comes with a better solution to implement custom nodes and a series of [UI improvements](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-design-update-have-a-look-at-our-improved-user-interface-d92af28b1ee9).

**SET UP PROXEUS**

**Step 1:** To install and run your own instance of Proxeus, follow the instructions published on [doc.proxeus.com](http://doc.proxeus.com/#/). Always make sure that you always pull Docker images from the official \`proxeus\` DockerHub repository and that you are using the latest version.

**Step 2:** Once your Proxeus platform is up and running, head over to the [configuration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/edit) in the handbook and follow the configuration steps. After completing the power up, you can log in with your newly created root user account. We recommend you always start by connecting to the Ropsten testnet and test your applications extensively.

**Step 3:** Deploy your own Proxeus smart contract following the instructions you will find in the documentation, or if you prefer, use our demo contract.

_If you are only interested to give Proxeus a quick try, we are running_ [_a demo platform_](https://demo.proxeus.com/) _connected to the Ropsten testnet, which you can use to get familiar with Proxeus instead of deploying your own instance. Please be aware that this platform is only available for demo purposes and the data is therefore being wiped on a regular basis: make sure to check the schedule published on the Proxeus website in order to avoid losing your work._

**CREATE YOUR FIRST APPLICATION**

Now that you have successfully installed and configured your Proxeus platform, you can start creating your first application. A minimal workflow comprises one template and a form to gather the data to be inserted into the document.

There are vast possibilities to use Proxeus that require zero programming. Proxeus “out of the box” is a powerful document automation platform with blockchain capabilities. You can customize the platform to your liking: place your own logo, change any text label or add multi-language support. You can configure workflows with intuitive, dynamic user forms by using the drag & drop editors.

Once your first workflow is ready, you can decide to keep it for yourself or to make it available to third-parties. For that go to the workflow workspace, set a price (in XES tokens) and click on the publish button: your workflow will become accessible to other users and you will receive a fee in XES tokens each time a workflow execution is purchased.

**EXTEND PROXEUS**

External nodes is an extension system allowing technical users to add functionality to their workflows without touching the Proxeus Core application. You can install extensions provided by the community without writing any code — or decide to create your own. If you are running your own software product, you could for example build an external node allowing Proxeus platform Operators to give their users direct access to your product. Learn more about external nodes on the [developers page](https://www.proxeus.com/developers).

**ACCESS AND MODIFY THE OPEN SOURCE CODE**

Users with software development skills have even more comprehensive ways to customize the software. Be it for your own needs or as a contributor to the Proxeus open source community, you can deep dive into the application’s inner workings.

Proxeus is completely open source and the full code and documentation for all of the elements of the Proxeus framework has been released on the [official Proxeus GitHub account](https://github.com/ProxeusApp) repositories. where you will find:

*   Proxeus Core — the main application for creating and running workflows
*   Document Service — the service that renders templates into PDFs and DOCX
*   ProxeusFS — an example Proxeus smart contract

**GET INSPIRED**

Prior to this release, we developed several prototypes showing how the framework can be used to incorporate new businesses, issue course certificates, create donation receipts, certify assets, track shipments or make anti-doping processes more secure — those examples are detailed on a dedicated section of the [website](http://www.proxeus.com/discover). We also created two additional application examples as additional inspiration to the community and demonstrate how workflows can be monetized using XES: a tax reporting tool for crypto assets and a proof of prior existence workflow. Both come with full code and documentation and are deployed on the demo platform.

**A WORD OF CAUTION**

The Proxeus software has undergone a series of audits before its open source release. Despite all precautions, users should not postulate that all security-relevant issues have been identified. In fact, the assumption must be made that there will be more bugs. You are using the Proxeus software or any code from its GitHub repositories at your own risk. If you decide to use the Proxeus software, do your own research and be sure to have read and understood the documentation beforehand. You are encouraged to thoroughly inspect the code that you will run before attempting to do anything.

**BECOME A CONTRIBUTOR**

The open source community is a huge worldwide movement with countless brilliant minds, and we are convinced that external contributors can have an immense impact on the Proxeus software going forward: some will hunt bugs and contribute to increase the security for everyone. Others will make suggestions for improvements or for whole new features. Business-minded people will come up with new use cases and concepts for industry-specific applications. Creative minds will contribute to further improve the user interface and to upgrade the user experience. Open source communities are incredibly resourceful — passion for good software, curiosity for new ideas and the joy of achieving something together are great motivators.

How about you? If you feel that you could contribute something and want to put your own mark on the project, the Proxeus community will be more than happy to welcome you. Make sure to follow our [Twitter updates](https://twitter.com/proxeusapp) and get in touch with us about possibilities to contribute in the future.

Every Ending is a new Beginning
===============================

June 9, 2020

With the open sourcing of Proxeus, Proxeus Anstalt has achieved the mission it was entrusted with by the token holder community and will be winded down, while Proxeus will be becoming a community-run project.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5edfb6fc58665539b2ee7269_1_63NaTJucm9sATOSpX2JQ9Q.jpg)

_In September 2019, we announced the delivery of Proxeus v1 offering anyone the possibility to install and run an instance of Proxeus making transactions on livenet. Since then, several improvements have been made to implement recommendations received through a series of functional and technical audit rounds, and integrate community feedback. Today, Proxeus Anstalt has published v1.1 of the Proxeus framework as open source software. With this step, Proxeus Anstalt has achieved the mission it was entrusted with by the token holder community and will be winded down, while Proxeus will be becoming a community-run project._

**Why Proxeus?**

By enabling trust to be established algorithmically without a need for the counterparties of a business transaction to know each other, blockchain technology creates new framework conditions allowing innovative business models to emerge. Yet blockchain is largely uncharted territory and the technological and financial barriers to create those new models are still high. Just like Wordpress empowered companies and enthusiasts to create websites without starting from a blank page at the beginning of the Internet, the Proxeus project was started to make blockchain technology more accessible and shorten the time necessary to create and test document-oriented blockchain use cases. In essence, the framework can be seen as a bridge connecting two worlds and allowing on the one hand individuals and businesses to digitize traditional processes and register information on a blockchain, and on the other one to make blockchain activity visible by generating human-readable documents.

**From vision to product**

Following a successful Token Generating Event and as per the project whitepaper, Proxeus appointed BlockFactory AG, a software development company based in Zug, Switzerland, to develop a software solution corresponding to the requirements outlined in the Proxeus whitepaper document. BlockFactory set out to tackle this objective by scoping the project alongside the following main pillars and principles:

**Software architecture**: Proxeus should have a strong foundation to allow community projects to scale. The key technology choices were made in anticipation of the future needs. The product architecture was analyzed and improved with a special focus on the compatibility of Proxeus with external systems, thereby maximizing the chances of adoption of the product by the developer community.

**User needs and requirements**: What functionality does the community expect? In order to put the whitepaper ideas into context and receive direct user feedback at different steps along the way, BlockFactory worked with external partners to develop a series of projects using the Proxeus technology stack in various contexts. The engineering team made the Proxeus code available in the context of events such as hackathons, allowing to gather input from developers with various backgrounds, and calls for community feedback were launched upon reaching key milestones.

**Usability**: Do the features and functions support the Proxeus mission to make blockchain more easily accessible? Poor user experience is currently one of the key reasons for the lack of adoption of blockchain technology by the wider public. Usability was a key principle in the product decisions made along the way and led us to deliver Proxeus as a hosted platform allowing its operators to make the best of two worlds — combining decentralized identities, payments and other blockchain capabilities with the advantages of operating a system in a server or cloud environment. This setup reduces adoption barriers and removes distribution challenges.

Over the past two years, BlockFactory worked with industry partners on projects using the Proxeus technology stack in various contexts: from [speeding up the incorporation of Swiss companies](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576) to [tokenizing a supercar](https://medium.com/proxeus/blockchain-enables-investing-in-classic-cars-for-everybody-not-just-millionaires-5e9dec740aee), demonstrating a [track-and-trace solution](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-technology-enables-shipment-tracking-system-based-on-iota-91484c503978) for the logistics space, [making university diplomas tamper-proof](/blog-posts/swiss-university-certificates-turn-tamper-proof-thanks-to-blockchain) or [improving anti-doping processes](/blog-posts/bringing-blockchain-to-the-anti-doping-world). This inflow of requirements based on concrete user needs constituted an important help for concretizing the architecture, scope and functionalities of the solution. Several of those initiatives also received international recognition and media coverage, creating global awareness for Proxeus and inspiring community members to prototype and test their own ideas.

In addition to community validation, the solution delivered today as open-source software has been audited by a series of independent product, technical, legal and security experts, and several rounds of improvements took place to implement their recommendations. The final feedback we received from Old School GmbH, a specialised consultancy based in Crypto Valley who reviewed the product functionality, made us very proud: according to its founder Bernd Lapp, “the Proxeus software was not only built with all key functionality originally promised, it also includes a series of useful additions and the product stands out as very intuitive and visually attractive. Proxeus contributes to the credibility of the blockchain space as a whole and we hope to see more projects release a valuable product in the future.”

**What comes next: towards a decentralized governance**

Proxeus was designed as a community initiative from the start and as the software is being open sourced, its further development will be driven by its users. A new not-for-profit body aiming to maintain and develop the Proxeus software going forward — Proxeus Association — was recently created by a group of trusted and committed community members. Proxeus Association aims to set up a decentralized governance structure enabling the global stakeholder community to take influence on future developments, and will take over the management of all communication channels (social media, blog, website) from this point on.

**Thank you**

Proxeus was set up with a mission to enable anyone to create document-centered applications leveraging the blockchain. Moving from a visionary whitepaper to a concrete software product was a long road consisting of many challenges and breakthroughs. We faced strong headwinds and battled our way through deep crypto winter. We had to revise our assumptions several times along the way and we inevitably made a few wrong decisions, but setbacks have also made us stronger: we had a lot of amazing successes and the team showed extraordinary dedication to bring the project to completion.

We would like to make a special thank you to our unique community, whose members have shown overwhelming support for the project from the start and shared their feedback and enthusiasm during good and difficult times alike. It’s been fascinating to watch the Proxeus project gradually take its own dynamic, covering use cases going even beyond the possibilities that we had in mind when the project started. It is still early days and the Proxeus ecosystem has only started to grow. As the code is handed over to the community, this toolbox will serve a growing number of individuals and organizations interested to explore the possibilities offered at the intersection of document workflows and decentralized ledgers.

Thank you also to our partners, in particular to the BlockFactory team, who oversaw the technical aspects of the project and worked extremely hard to build the product and has seen things to the very end. Many of the project members will continue supporting Proxeus in various roles after a much-needed break and we can’t wait to see what new ideas will come to life over the coming years. The journey to large-scale blockchain adoption is still a long one and we are the first to recognize that it is only beginning, but with the Proxeus v1.1 release, we just contributed our part towards this vision.

Introducing Proxeus Open Source Association
===========================================

June 9, 2020

On June 9, 2020, Proxeus Anstalt announced that following completion of the goals set at the occasion of the Proxeus TGE in February 2018, it will step down from its role of developer and maintainer of the Proxeus framework. This post addresses the question of maintenance and future developments relating to the Proxeus framework going forward.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5edfbcc97e92241b7cb7fe55_Proxeus%20Association.png)

_On June 9, 2020, Proxeus Anstalt_ [_announced_](https://medium.com/proxeus/every-ending-is-a-new-beginning-a5bffeb890a9) _that following completion of the goals set at the occasion of the Proxeus TGE in February 2018, it will step down from its role of developer and maintainer of the Proxeus framework. This post addresses the question of maintenance and future developments relating to the Proxeus framework going forward._

**Our vision**

Decentralized technologies create new framework conditions allowing innovative business models to emerge. Yet a lot of blockchain ideas stay stuck in the heads of entrepreneurs because the technological and financial barriers to create them are too high. Web development has seen a “no code” revolution over the last decade, with new tools — such as the blogging and content management software WordPress — leading to the creation of a lot of value for society at large. We want to participate to the democratization of blockchain applications.

**About us**

A group of people with deep expertise in software and open source technologies, who believe that Proxeus is a valuable framework with potential to gain broader acceptance. As maintenance and further development of the software is reliant on the existence of an active community of users, we have set ourselves the mission to establish a governing body for Proxeus with the following objectives:

*   Set up community governance mechanisms using the XES token
*   Maintain and develop the Proxeus framework
*   Foster innovation and increase framework attractiveness
*   Develop long term funding sources for the Proxeus framework

Proxeus Anstalt — the organization that set up the Proxeus TGE in 2018 — has announced the completion of its mission and will be winded down. As part of this process, Proxeus Association has been tasked with the responsibility for a series of key aspects of the project, such as ownership of the source code license, ownership of the project’s source code repositories, governance of the XES reserve and management of the Proxeus communication channels, and has been provided with funding to execute its vision.

**Project Roadmap**

We have high ambitions for Proxeus and we have set out to work on four tracks: product, community, governance and funding. We are currently working on giving visibility and transparency to the activities planned for the next project phase.

**_Product_  
**Proxeus Association compensates maintainers and incentivizes contributors to the Proxeus framework. We allocate resources based on the defined roadmap and scheduled improvements. We post bounties and associate a reward to the development of specific desired features, or accept improvements proposed by external developers.

**_Community_**  
We launch and support community initiatives, and we create synergies and partner with relevant community-driven projects. We accept funding applications from external projects. Requests are accepted for projects that aim to add a net value to the Proxeus ecosystem as a whole, and will be thoroughly reviewed.

**_Governance_**  
We endeavour to develop ways to crowdsource decisions in order to increase community involvement and create a direct alignment between the software usage and development and the interests of the token holders. DAOs are considered interesting constructs to run a decentralized governance body, and the Executive Board will work towards the vision of enabling XES holders to directly take influence on the project course.

**_Funding_**  
We strive to put the Proxeus framework on a stable long-term financial basis. In addition to the possible mechanisms a governance DAO can offer (e.g. link community engagement to XES scarcity through staking), we will be developing a series of traditional funding sources, among which the acceptance of donations and the seeking of grants connected to partnerships within the open source ecosystem.

**Initial thoughts on decentralized governance**

DAOs offer the possibility to develop a governance structure that reflects the interests of the community and translates an increase in framework usage or in community engagement into a reduction of the available token supply. The Aragon framework for example could offer the possibility to issue voting tokens to community members who decide to stake their XES for a certain period. The number of tokens issued would depend on staking duration (the longer tokens are staked, the more voting tokens would be issued proportionally) and the voting tokens can then be used by community members to take influence on strategic product/framework issues, or to validate the allocation of grants to third-party projects. In order to create a DAO vehicle that is truly aligned with the community interests, this project should however not be rushed: it should be thoroughly reflected, discussed and tested. It therefore makes sense to plan it as part of the Proxeus Association 2020 roadmap.

**How can I be involved?**

There are several ways to get involved in the activities of the Proxeus Association: at the moment we are mainly looking for deployment maintainers and a [project manager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xn1ECVIaNxxyFe9LysYm91apA1YYQsOAJNKmRNaCF-A/edit).

We are also planning to open board membership to a larger circle. More information will follow on that in the second part of the year. In order to apply, candidates to the association board will need to fulfill the following conditions:

*   Interest for the product and for advancing the long term goals of Proxeus and/or existing meaningful contribution to the Proxeus codebase
*   Evidence of high ethical standards, good reputation and compliance with the Proxeus Open Source Association statutes
*   Absence of any conflict of interest with the Proxeus vision and ecosystem

If you have built a project using the Proxeus software, we would like to know more about it and how we can help you. Please contact us at [association@proxeus.com](mailto:association@proxeus.com)

**Who is behind Proxeus Association**

Proxeus Association is a non-profit association based in Berne, Switzerland, that is entirely dedicated to the maintenance, promotion and advancement of the Proxeus framework. The association is governed by an Executive Board currently consisting of three members:

**_Oleg Lavrovsky / Community lead_**  
A professional software engineer and consultant with two decades of IT experience, Oleg works with digital and local communities to build sustainable bridges in a world increasingly dependent on data. A recognized expert in and proponent of open systems, he is a member of the board of Opendata.ch — Swiss chapter of Open Knowledge Foundation — active in various communities as coach and organizer. As co-founder of the civic tech initiative Cividi, maintainer of the open source hackathon platform Dribdat, as well as contributor to dozens of mature open source projects, Oleg will be drawing on his community building and open development experience to make Proxeus “hackable”: attractive and widely useful to developer communities.

**_Fabian Mösli / Product lead_**  
After discovering the Proxeus project at the beginning of 2018, Fabian joined BlockFactory, the Swiss software development company mandated by Proxeus Anstalt with the implementation of the project whitepaper. He was soon overseeing several product management streams and became one of the driving forces and key knowledge carriers behind the successful completion of the mandate. Fabian has now moved on to his next challenge but he is still burning with unbroken enthusiasm for DLT and decentralized applications and therefore volunteered to contribute his product knowledge to Proxeus Association, which will also allow him to stay in contact with the community.

**_Vivien Fuhrer / Admin lead_**  
Vivien is a seasoned financial expert with several years of experience in the cryptocurrency field. He will be leading the administrative aspects of Proxeus Association with the primary responsibility over the accounting. He is also actively promoting the use of the Proxeus software within Switzerland by supporting community projects and initiatives.

**Looking ahead**

We believe that Proxeus is a fantastic tool with potential to facilitate the transition to a new digital economy. As the project is starting a new phase, we are excited by the journey ahead and are committed to bringing Proxeus to the next level. Proxeus Association is here to listen to the needs and wishes of the community, drive the further development of the product and foster adoption through various initiatives. As part of the project handover from Proxeus Anstalt, we have also taken over the management of the Proxeus official communication channels — follow our updates on our [blog](https://medium.com/proxeus) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/proxeusapp) and get in touch with us!

UI update: fresh looks and a more intuitive interface
=====================================================

March 25, 2020

After the release of Proxeus 1.0 in September last year, we’ve received questions, praise and improvement suggestions from the community. Some of the feedback concerned the user experience that the application offers or specific elements of the user interface design. The product team decided to implement improvements in the user interface to give it a fresh touch before open sourcing the software. Besides the visual changes, we’ve also made it easier for our users to customize their own Proxeus platforms.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab54cb44a484a2a6c2483_1_XGrhabWoYgNfEYdqk95cRw.png)

After the release of [Proxeus 1.0](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-v1-0-32144b628349) in September last year, we’ve received questions, praise and improvement suggestions from the community. Some of the feedback concerned the user experience that the application offers or specific elements of the user interface design.

The product team decided to implement improvements in the user interface to give it a fresh touch before open sourcing the software. Besides the visual changes, we’ve also made it easier for our users to customize their own Proxeus platforms.

If you’ve been an avid user of the platform before, you’ll certainly notice immediately that the way we’re displaying lists — your workflows, forms and templates — has been cleaned up to give you a much better overview of your elements and the available actions.

Another change that might stand out is that we’ve reorganized the menus. The most important buttons are now much easier to locate and all the other options won’t distract you any longer. We even got rid of the big old round button in the bottom right corner!

Other improvements comprise the introduction of a new main font, a few changes to the color palette, and an easy way to integrate your own logo. In the translations section, you’ll find an entry “Logo url” where you simply add the path to your logo. You can even choose a separate logo for each language.

Overall we believe that we’ve found a balanced approach to fulfil your change requests without changing the user interface so much that you have to relearn everything. The simpler design and more intuitive arrangement should give all users a better experience.

Below we share some before–after screenshots to give you an idea of the new user experience!

Let the Proxeus community know what you think and what you would change… it might just happen! Besides, Proxeus is now open-sourced completely, so you’ll be able make changes yourself, too!

– –

**Lists**

Lists have been redesigned to provide a better overview. The buttons are no longer just icons, but their function is spelled out. We’ve also replaced the round green “plus” button for creating new elements; it’s now above the list instead of hiding in the bottom right corner.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab4d55a8a0e7a1260874f_1*_CbRM5LlHyTtDk7omIUAPA.png)

**Workflows**

When editing elements such as workflows, it’s quite clear that the old UI just got more and more functions, leading to four “main” buttons dominating the view. We’ve reworked that to highlight only the two key actions.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab4d51489093b17f980a7_1*wdQ22GgglV0vhQiDnorLeg.png)

**Dropdowns**

Other elements such as dropdown menus have been revisited, too. It’s now much easier to find the right list item.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab4d5a453150bf0f4d4da_1*Q2GSFrEhz50-p7md6bxjgQ.png)

**Templates**

The previously cluttered template preview window has been cleaned up and helps you keep an overview of all your template versions even if your platform has several activated languages.

**Form editor**

The form editor has been revamped, too. The key actions are now all next to each other and the Save button is highlighted.

Proxeus & Hyperledger: Combining powers
=======================================

March 17, 2020

Proxeus made history by helping to speed up company incorporations in Switzerland to under two hours (find more details here). In a previous blog post we spoke to the lawyer Philippe Kaiser from Kaiser Odermatt & Partner who is involved in the project. To provide another view on the project we asked Ulrich Schimpel, member of IBM CTO Europe Team, about his thoughts and experiences.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab47e89da3c4e94f0bcf4_1_OgRRWozwu9uNGoTBHCQScg.jpg)

_Proxeus made history by helping to speed up company incorporations in Switzerland to under two hours (find more details_ [_here_](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/swiss-using-blockchain-to-refine-clunky-business-incorporation-2018-5)_). In a_ [_previous blog post_](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576) _we spoke to the lawyer Philippe Kaiser from Kaiser Odermatt & Partner who is involved in the project. To provide another view on the project we asked Ulrich Schimpel, member of IBM CTO Europe Team, about his thoughts and experiences._

**Can you tell us more about the company register project and its objectives?**

The project is about an end-to-end acceleration when you are founding a Swiss company. It’s not about replacing any party involved in such a process but it brings together all the pieces that are needed including notaries, banks and the commercial registrar. The objective is clearly to speed up the founding process to a few days compared to several weeks and to have a much better transparency across different players.

**You set a new record by founding the first Swiss company on the blockchain in under 100 minutes, instead of the usual 10 days. How did you achieve that?**

We did this experiment as a realistic fire drill to find the limit of this process. This means, everyone involved was informed but we did not know the name of the company to be founded. It was only when the jury actually chose a name that we were able to start the process, fill in all the information and have the correct name in the files, for example, to open a bank account.

This experiment was very insightful because it showed us that founding a company was possible in under two hours and the delays will hopefully be reduced step by step in the future. We achieved this result not by revolutionizing the entire process but by cleverly combining different components: Of course, we used digitization but we also reused existing, already very well working infrastructure and our job was to put these different components together. This is the main reason why we could actually achieve this impressive result.

**Why did you choose Proxeus as a core partner to start this business ecosystem?**

First of all, the Proxeus team is highly innovative, agile and engaged and perfectly fits the spirit of all other core partners. This is also true when it comes to their product: Proxeus is a highly flexible tool to pull together all relevant information in a user-friendly workflow that — in the very beginning — we did not know how it would look like. Having to define and configure this workflow including roles etc. and being able to do it in an intuitive way was very helpful. We configured Proxeus as a web solution which was a must for us, and it provides a very good user experience for the people who need to fill in the data and produce the required documents. All in all, the Proxeus platform offered a tremendous support for this pioneering initiative.

**Why did you choose to implement a Hyperledger blockchain? How did you set it up and what role does it play in the company incorporation process?**

We used a Hyperledger Fabric as a permissioned blockchain because we are working in a regulated industry environment. This requires to know the identities of the participating players and to employ flexible and role-based accessibility and visibility policies: A bank has different rights and obligations than the commercial registrar or a notary and we have to make sure that only a bank can for example issue a bank certificate and only a commercial registrar can approve a company foundation. Furthermore, we don’t need a mining process to guarantee consistency of the blockchain as the set of current and future participants like Cantons and banks offer a high standard of trustworthiness, professionality and mutual independence.

In our setup the Hyperledger fabric blockchain has a logging mechanism which makes the whole process revision-proof: You can see exactly when the bank actually approved or uploaded a certificate or when the notary actually approved that all the necessary steps for the foundation have been completed.

**How does the Hyperledger contract communicate with the Proxeus application?**

Just like everything in our joint project with the partners was very lean and agile, we implemented a very lean interface between Proxeus and the Hyperledger fabric blockchain. Information typed in or provided by the users in the Proxeus interface (e.g. name of the new company and its founders and the chosen notary) is not only filled into the documents but also transmitted to the blockchain-enabled workflow system, where it is used to dynamically set up the adequate access rights. Only involved process parties will then have the rights to access a certain foundation.

**What are your learnings from this project?**

There are two key learnings: First, regarding the lean approach I already mentioned reusing existing components, processes and infrastructures and, second, regarding the ecosystem. Like many (maybe all) industrial blockchain projects, ours depends a lot on the ecosystem of partners and how they are actually being orchestrated, how they interact and collaborate. This is an evolutionary journey which should be given sufficient attention. Technology is only one part of the project, the other part is about real processes in the real world and — in our case — with a lot of legal aspects as well. In some cases, we actually had to employ “workarounds” because of legal restrictions and in order to be fully compliant with Swiss law. Such issues make it necessary that the partners are working together efficiently, and while short communication paths must be in place, we also needed to give it necessary time to evolve at certain points. Basically, the project as a whole but also each partner needs to have sufficient time to make the necessary clarification adjustments and changes for themselves.

“We digitized over $200 billion in bonds onto the blockchain with Proxeus”
==========================================================================

March 5, 2020

From smart cities to fintech to blockchain, Global ReEnergy Holdings is busy finding best practice solutions that can shape our digital future. We sat down with its CEO, Dr. Jonathan R. Everhart, to talk about current challenges and his experiences with the Proxeus platform that his company uses for InnovativBank.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab2976197012fbe8f9b88_1_fBvh-eTOM9gRhRqizMXuEw.png)

_From smart cities to fintech to blockchain,_ [_Global ReEnergy Holdings_](https://www.globalreenergyinc.com/) _is busy finding best practice solutions that can shape our digital future. We sat down with its CEO, Dr. Jonathan R. Everhart, to talk about current challenges and his experiences with the Proxeus platform that his company uses for InnovativBank._

**What is InnovativBank?**

[InnovativBank](https://www.innovativbank.com/) is a wholly-owned fintech subsidiary of ours that focuses on shaping the future of global financial markets. We use technology solutions–such as Proxeus–within the fintech arena and deploy them with institutions in the financial services industry. All current demonstrations with the Proxeus platform are operated through InnovativBank.

**What services and applications does InnovativBank provide to its clients?**

InnovativBank provides a variety of fintech solutions to financial institutions, such as smart lending, digital trade finance, and blockchain. We continuously source new fintech solutions to add to our technology portfolio and provide them to the institutions we work with.

**Who are your clients?**

Our clients are mainly B2B and B2G. We are working globally with a number of financial institutions, international financial centers, and stock exchanges to integrate our fintech solutions.

**What will the smart city of the future look like?**

Our company is involved with the United Nations Science-Policy-Business Forum. I serve on its Green Technology Advisory Board. The purpose of the forum and my role on the advisory board is to create best practices across financing, policy, and technology to accelerate sustainable digital economies around the world. In this role, we meet in different forums and high-level working groups to identify the best solutions around the globe, that–from policy, finance, and technology perspectives–have the potential to accelerate sustainable digital economies. We gather insights from cities and organizations that have successfully deployed a particular solution in one area and disseminate these best practices under the umbrella of the United Nations to other member nations, their delegates, and leaders. What governments and organizations essentially get are blueprints that help them accelerate the crafting of their own digital economy frameworks. Through this work, I see the smart city of the future to be locally customized digital ecosystems around the world–and in outer-space–where people work in tandem with technology to improve their lives and their environment.

**What are the main challenges implementing it?**

While the media is pushing and creating a lot of hyped sentiment around every sector of the digital economy–such as smart cities, blockchain, and artificial intelligence–we are still very early and barely scratching the surface. Globally, we need to continue to cultivate the best policies, financing options, and technology frameworks to invest in, and–from an operational standpoint–promote business models that can be sustained in the long-run. In order to continue accelerating the digital economy transformation, our company is going to continue to work with organizations like the United Nations and technologies like Proxeus to drive useful and commercially-viable solutions globally.

**How did you come across Proxeus?**

My team and I spend a lot of time reading and researching new solutions, opportunities, and technologies which can be added to our portfolio. We came across Proxeus in an article about the [Swiss business incorporation use case](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576). In the blockchain space, one of the biggest challenges is not only finding entities that have the technological solution, but also finding the solutions that fit within a commercially-viable use case. Our team’s extensive experience in technology, finance, and law helps us to identify such technological solutions within a specific niche that can then be deployed from a viable commercial standpoint.

**What is your first impression with the Proxeus tool?**

We started using Proxeus back in November 2019 and now, during the first quarter of 2020, we are conducting demonstrations with several financial institutions, international financial centers, and stock exchanges. Our commercial interest lies in digitizing financial instruments onto the blockchain through the Proxeus platform. Within this use case we are currently focusing on green bonds. We recently launched a $1 trillion global green bond issuance initiative through our affiliation with the United Nations Science-Policy-Business Forum. The goal of this initiative is to register $1 trillion in current and future green bonds onto the blockchain in order to increase transparency in the global green bond market, enhance the custody of green bond transaction records, and enhance the audit trail of green bond transaction records. This will assist in increasing confidence and subsequent investments in the global sustainable bond market. More importantly, it will demonstrate the commercial capabilities of blockchain on a large scale which industries worldwide are seeking to achieve. To date, we have digitized over $200 billion in exchange-listed green bonds from around the world onto the Proxeus platform. I will be showcasing this initiative at this year’s United Nations Science-Policy-Business Forum as an example of the policy and commercial work of the Forum in action. This achievement shows the commercial capabilities and benefits of using blockchain to digitize financial instruments.

Using the Proxeus platform has been very simple. It keeps its promise of being the “WordPress for blockchain.” Building out our specific templates and workflows has been a seamless process, and it works great for our demonstrations. We did not have any major issues and all technical questions were immediately answered by the support team. Proxeus has been very useful for us. We see its application globally within different industries, expanding beyond the financial services sector. For example, the Proxeus tool in commercial real estate could be used in a number of workflows to digitize real estate records. It can also be used in the intellectual property sector to digitize patent, trademark, and copyright registrations.

**Are you planning to use Proxeus for future projects as well?**

Yes, we do. The first step is to show proof-of-concepts for viable commercial use cases to institutions. This involves not only showing that blockchain works, but more importantly educating institutions on blockchain and beneficial use cases that they have not yet considered. The next step is to continue to deploy the Proxeus platform in projects with these institutions, as they see the benefits of blockchain within their operations. We definitely see the benefits of the platform and anticipate using it in the long-run.

Proxeus partners with the Swiss Blockchain Institute
====================================================

February 12, 2020

Today we proudly announce that Proxeus joined forces with the Geneva-based Swiss Blockchain Institute. The Institute will be using the Proxeus framework to issue blockchain-registered diplomas as well as possibly adding the framework to its academic program in the future, enabling its students to quickly prototype and test their project ideas.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd6a175d7b20a3421f0de_1_ZL78FX8wGZKDzfYG4GvmhQ.jpg)

The Swiss Blockchain Institute opened its doors back in October 2019. As a training institution entirely dedicated to blockchain, its main objective is to close the current gap between the offer and demand of blockchain professionals. As its founder Matthieu Collas states, today for every trained blockchain development engineer on the marketplace there are 14 recruitment requests from companies.

The Institute trains its students on various programming languages like Ethereum, Solidity, Hyperledger, Corda, Tezos and others. In the long term, it also aims to integrate Proxeus to its training offering: “Proxeus is often compared to WordPress as it allows to simplify the creation of applications that interact with the blockchain. Making students familiar with the framework will give them precious new skills as they will be empowered to quickly prototype new products and services,” says Collas.

Following completion of a program, participants receive a certificate in accordance with the selected training. “Making our credentials immutable and easily verifiable is a natural step for the Institute and it provides an extra layer of security for both students and employers,” says Collas. Such certificates are tamper-proof which makes fraud impossible. Apart from using Proxeus to issue students certificates, the Institute is also looking for other use cases where the framework could enhance internal and external processes.

‍

Proxeus workflows: a strong backbone
====================================

January 22, 2020

In past articles we explored Proxeus forms, smart templates and the document service. Proxeus workflows is where all elements come together — let’s take a look how they constitute the backbone of every Proxeus application by defining the process logic and connecting to various actions and input sources.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd72f63723e4181a8f369_1_d8qHc9TsXuD2m5sLdLrmXQ.png)

**What is a Proxeus workflow?**
-------------------------------

A Proxeus workflow is a series of sequential steps that are carried out based on user-defined rules or conditions in order to execute a business process. Workflows enable Proxeus users to [digitize their know-how](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-wrap-your-know-how-digitally-a99150875ffe) and to make it available to third parties, for free or for a fee paid in XES.

**Creating and editing workflows**
----------------------------------

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd7410e1706ae75824e45_1*19tGOfoXhEn0dRB8VNLv_A.png)

The workflow manager offers an interface to assemble and update workflows by combining [forms](https://medium.com/proxeus/gather-structured-information-using-proxeus-forms-e08abcf103aa) and [smart templates](https://medium.com/proxeus/using-proxeus-smart-templates-957eefb75315). Components are added to the workspace via drag & drop and can then be dynamically linked in a sequential flow. Data sources or external services are integrated through the addition of connectors. The resulting workflow can be given various access rights and made available to third parties in the front-end.


**Workflow logic**
------------------

“Conditions” may be added as graphical elements in the workflow to enable the creation of dynamic decision engines that make the logic, steering and scope of the data collection process dependent on values entered by the end users during the workflow execution process. They can be created easily using IF-functions of JavaScript. Examples are available in the Proxeus [handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/preview#heading=h.t8n5j48zabtn).

_Example of a simple condition element: script (left) and workflow view (right)_

‍

**Process finalization**
------------------------

Following the completion of all steps, workflows are finalized by calling the [document service](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-document-service-document-templating-made-easy-5304b4ead44e). It then generates the final document(s) by combining the data collected via forms and connectors during the workflow execution together with the variables from document templates that have been included into the workflow. As a final step of every workflow execution, the human readable workflow output (.pdf) is hashed and the hash registered on the Registry Smart Contract (which has been set up by the operator as part of the initial platform deployment, alongside a record of the Ethereum identity of the end user as the issuer of the document). The validation of the corresponding transaction also gives the possibility to add a public reference in order to make the documents registered more easily identifiable.

**Custom connectors and nodes**
-------------------------------

‍

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd74275d7b2bf9221f94c_1*JmeYN9slmwg9fIzA3LTNMg.png)

_Representation of custom connectors in the workflow workspace_

‍

“Custom Connectors” are workflow nodes that extend the possibilities offered out of the box by connecting to external services in order to retrieve data from a designated source or to execute predefined operations (such as sending an email notification). Custom connectors and nodes will be the subject of a separate post detailing the different possibilities they offer to augment the Proxeus experience.

**Machine-readable output**
---------------------------

The machine-readable workflow output — a JSON containing the values collected for the variables specified in the workflow — is stored on the platform database and can be accessed via the I/O layer. In addition to manual inputs from end users during the workflow execution, forms can be populated via API calls to external services using the I/O layer. Combined with the possibility to trigger workflows based on the occurrence of certain events, this functionality enables workflow creators to build a fully automated document production service for their use case.

**Interoperability**
--------------------

The workflows can be exported locally and are operable on any Proxeus platform, ensuring that workflow creators and their intellectual property (expressed as workflows, forms and templates) are not dependent on a specific Proxeus platform.

Are you working on interesting use cases pushing the limits of what the framework offers? Are you wondering whether Proxeus can be used to implement your idea? Share your progress with us and get in touch with our dev team, we are always grateful for feedback and happy to support!

‍From beta to v1: Proxeus 2019 review
====================================

December 20, 2019

The year is slowly coming to an end, a phase which gives us a good opportunity to look back at what happened in the past months and what’s ahead of us. As the American poet T.S. Eliot once wrote: “Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.”

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd8e4512f4e2d00a8774a_1_utOiixUJLtmuWMXg70iFYQ.jpg)

The year is slowly coming to an end, a phase which gives us a good opportunity to look back at what happened in the past months and what’s ahead of us. As the American poet T.S. Eliot once wrote: “Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.”

This year gave us the chance to explore uncharted territory by deploying Proxeus in new environments, and to work with the community to gather and implement feedback in order to improve the product before and after the [livenet release (v1)](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-v1-0-32144b628349).

Here is a brief overview of what happened in 2019:

**Exploring uncharted territory**
---------------------------------

Following several Ethereum and Hyperledger projects, the Proxeus technology was successfully leveraged in March to implement a decentralised shipment tracking system based on IOTA. An ambitious prototype was presented in which RFID chips were used to track pallets across physical terminals connected to the blockchain. The terminal would send the tracking data (such as the consignment ID, the terminal name or even the signatory name) directly to the IOTA ledger without any human intervention, triggering the automatic and instantaneous generation via a Proxeus instance of pre-templated documents (such as the Bill of Lading as well as various shipping receipts) based on the data retrieved from the IOTA ledger. Read more about this use case [here](/blog-posts/proxeus-technology-enables-shipment-tracking-system-based-on-iota).

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd8be2089e50dbf933aa9_1*ClWizkuEbqTwtQ_weRfCFQ.png)

In a totally different space, Proxeus was used by the International Testing Agency to prototype the digitization of an anti-doping process ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics. The use case was the following: an athlete having medical reasons to take a prohibited substance can apply to receive a certificate granting them an exemption for therapeutic use (TUE). Such exemption is given after consideration of an independent medical board and for a set prohibited substance, in a certain dosage, within a limited period. This TUE request process was standardised using the Proxeus framework, enabling the production and signature of documents with a crypto identity and making the finalized TUE file easily verifiable on a drag and drop interface. Get more information in [this post](/blog-posts/bringing-blockchain-to-the-anti-doping-world).

**Swiss Blockchain Hackathon**
------------------------------

We jumped into cold water and made the Proxeus software available to the community for the first time at the Swiss Blockchain Hackathon. The team coached several participants to create use cases based on the framework and following this test round, they spent the whole Summer consolidating and improving the software in order to get ready for the Proxeus v1 release.

**Proxeus reaches livenet!**
----------------------------

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d8b1c67d56fb34ebe5cc2be_1*CiLHvbqj2Va7pRSWQ4J4YQ.png)

After months of hard work, we were thrilled to announce the release of Proxeus v1 in September, the first version using XES tokens on livenet. A general overview has been published in [this post](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-v1-0-32144b628349) and the detailed requirements for setting up a platform can be found in the product [handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/preview). Read through and understand the [documentation](http://doc.proxeus.com/) before attempting to install and run your own instance of Proxeus, and make sure that you always pull Docker images from the official \`proxeus\` DockerHub repository. Not least you should be careful to use the latest version. If you want to give it a quick try first, a [demo platform](http://demo.proxeus.com/) running on the Ropsten testnet has been made available for testing purposes.

**Product improvements and next steps**
---------------------------------------

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd8bec9fe84549d9c5d41_1*PIDb2OBWKvD8b7h0_uD00g.png)

The team spent the last months focused on making improvements, resolving issues reported by users, and giving product or technical support to various community members. We shared updates on projects started in earlier phases such as the [registration of Swiss companies](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576?source=collection_home---4------9-----------------------) and the [certification of investment-grade cars](https://medium.com/proxeus/blockchain-enables-investing-in-classic-cars-for-everybody-not-just-millionaires-5e9dec740aee). Finally, we had a series of fascinating discussions with key ecosystem players exploring ideas at the intersection of blockchain and other fields, such as the [Internet of Things](https://medium.com/proxeus/our-mission-is-to-provide-trusted-real-time-data-as-a-commodity-aeb5a1d5118d) and [social media](https://medium.com/proxeus/its-only-a-matter-of-sitting-down-and-defining-the-processes-fe309312dae3).

The next big step on the roadmap is the open sourcing of Proxeus — a release candidate is currently under review and we will share more information on that as soon as we can.

Once again, thank you all for your overwhelming support — we would be nowhere without the support of our community. As always, our door is open and we welcome feedback on any aspect of the project.

‍Gather structured information using Proxeus forms
=================================================

December 17, 2019

This week we take a closer look at Proxeus forms which collect data from human users or from Blockchain events and make this information available to create any type of document.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd9c33c286a83c850232c_1_z1hdIU61_HdZXrwfqw4xUw.png)

**What are Proxeus forms?**
---------------------------

Proxeus forms enable workflows to collect information from users (humans and machines). Each form allows to structure one segment of the data acquisition. Let’s say for example that you would like to create a [company incorporation workflow](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576): the first step will be to ask users for a series of details (domicile, company name, number of shares, members of the board, etc.). This information will then be exported in a machine-readable format and applied to a series of [smart templates](https://medium.com/proxeus/using-proxeus-smart-templates-957eefb75315) in order to produce a human-readable output that can eventually be reviewed and [signed](https://medium.com/proxeus/building-dapps-signature-integration-f2c7f5912595) by the various parties at stake.

**How are forms created?**
--------------------------

The Forms workspace is accessible via the backend view of the Proxeus platform. There, the form generator offers an interface to create, duplicate and update forms, as well as to manage the access rights for the forms you own. A large set of components is available by default, including items such as text fields, radio buttons, check boxes and drop-downs.

Those standard components can be dragged from right to left and arranged freely on the form. A click on a component opens a section on the right where attributes can be selected. On top of the mandatory specifications, users can add a number of optional elements, such as help texts or conditions for validating the data that is inputted.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd9e92089e5eb18934461_1*2oNYD3u9wK1rmSIfEe9qNg.png)

**Custom components**
---------------------

While the broad range of standard components can be used by anyone without specific programming skills, Creators with knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and JSON have the flexibility to customize existing components or create new ones from scratch. This feature enables advanced users to create custom fields tailored to their needs, such as adding a special phone number field that validates inputs against the Canadian phone number format, or checking if the input is a valid Ethereum address or an existing Twitter handle.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd9eb0e17061d40826768_1*5eg3tat55qJe8-icSE7-yw.png)

Once created, forms can be accessed and assembled from the workflow manager. They can be shared with multiple workflows and therefore be used in different contexts. This means that the time you spend setting up advanced data collection tools (for example creating a custom drop-down list to reflect your company inventory) is an investment that you can benefit from in different contexts because the components will be updated across all of your workflows every time they are modified.

**Conditional formatting**
--------------------------

An important feature allowing you to streamline the data acquisition flow is the possibility to add elements that will be displayed to the user only if certain conditions are met. If you create a [collectible car certificate](https://medium.com/proxeus/blockchain-enables-investing-in-classic-cars-for-everybody-not-just-millionaires-5e9dec740aee), you will for example want to ask for different information depending on the brand or model selected in the first place. This can be done easily via the “Action” tab, where those dependencies can be programmed visually.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd9ea0e17060699826767_1*U6j3guCVAlXj0LEaY-k9Mg.png)

**One last check**
------------------

Select the “Test” tab and you will see the form as it will be presented to the endusers on the platform. This comes quite handy to briefly test your logic without requiring to actually publish and test the workflow.

What interesting application did you implement using Proxeus forms? Share your experience and let us know how we can support you!

Using Proxeus smart templates
=============================

November 21, 2019

In the digitization of a process, the creation of a human-readable output in the form of a document is often an important aspect. Proxeus enables users to create and use smart document templates comprising not only the desired layout and static content, but also a logic implemented through dynamic variables that can be filled into the forms that are part of the workflow. The functionality can be compared to “serial letters” in Microsoft Word, but is designed in a much more powerful way.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bda7863723eb1bea90b48_1_p10n7gY6zWd-TY2Of5h4uA.png)

**What are Proxeus smart templates?**
-------------------------------------

Proxeus smart templates are document templates created by users and added to a workflow. Upon workflow completion, they are sent to the [Proxeus document service](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-document-service-document-templating-made-easy-5304b4ead44e) alongside data collected via forms or API in order to produce a human-readable output.

**What makes those templates special?**
---------------------------------------

Users are entirely free to define their own content and layout to produce any document they need. While the basic templating features enable non-technical users to create simple templates within minutes, advanced users can use the full spectrum of the [JTwig templating engine](http://jtwig.org/documentation/reference) to create smart templates. Those can include formulas and even scripts, allowing users to implement a complex logic into their documents.

**What is the document format used for templating?**
----------------------------------------------------

Templates are created using the OpenDocument Text Document file format (.odt). Such files can be generated by open-source office suites such as LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice, but they are also supported by Microsoft Word and Apple TextEdit, which makes them very versatile.

**How can I create a template?**
--------------------------------

In order to create a template, start by drafting a workflow that collects inputs (for example a name) via Forms or Connectors. Let’s say that you would like to collect an email address: start by naming the input variable on the form (for example “input.EmailAddress”), then take your document template and simply add the variable {{input.EmailAddress}} at the place in the document where the user-entered input should appear. Lastly, upload the template and add it as an object to the workflow. A document using this template will then be automatically generated each time your workflow is run. If you would like to see a template in action, we added a simple example that you can re-use on the Proxeus [demo platform](/app).

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bda950e17068d76826d4f_1*tppFdD_5IXwP906lmaOXnQ.png)

**Too complicated?**
--------------------

In order to facilitate the creation of templates, variables entered into the form elements selected for the current workflow are automatically made available to the user in the right format via the “Templates” workspace. Click the variable to copy it to the clipboard and paste it into your document. The document preview functionality enables you to quickly test and fix your templates. Go to the “Templates” workspace to preview the result of your actions in real time.

**Where can I find more information?**

Proxeus document service — document templating made easy
========================================================

November 8, 2019

The Proxeus document service is an integral part of the framework and was built from scratch to offer state of the art possibilities in the field of document templating. We sat down with the team that develops this feature to get some insights.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdb530e1706647182715d_1_fUy2sgFXIDA8nIzE2NISng.png)

**Quickly explained: What is the Proxeus document service?**
------------------------------------------------------------

The document service is a document templating engine that is built as an integral part of the Proxeus framework. The service basically takes a template document and a JSON containing the data and renders it to a format like PDF, ODT or DOCX. While the current implementation only allows ODT as output format, the service supports all XML-based document solutions by design. So they can easily be included using the same core.

**Why did you create your own document service?**
-------------------------------------------------

Back in 2016 when we started to look for a templating engine solution for the Proxeus framework, there was nothing available that quite fit our idea, so we had to start from scratch. Today there are indeed a few similar solutions on the market.

**What differentiates it from other solutions?**
------------------------------------------------

The Proxeus document service is unique because its core dependency is a document format based on XML (like DOCX, XLS, ODT and many more). This principal characteristic makes it independent from LibreOffice or MS-Office as far as possible. Besides that, new features added for DOCX or ODT work out of the box without the need for any changes on the document service as long as they are on top of XML. Examples could be new formula features, specific features for table structures or paragraph and styling changes. Many other solutions out there are taking a different approach by reconstructing and integrating feature by feature of the external tool (LibreOffice or MS-Office for example). Such applications are much more static and need continuous adaptation if new features are added at the external tool whereas the beauty of the Proxeus document service lies in its independence and its generic, universal applicability.

**What types of documents does it support?**
--------------------------------------------

At the moment ODT is supported. But adding new XML-based formats like DOCX is quite easy as the Proxeus document service core is based on XML and not on document format specific things.

Building DApps: signature integration
-------------------------------------

October 29, 2019

Proxeus comes with a fully-fledged signature feature, allowing to send and receive signature requests. Signing a document creates a public cryptographic proof that can be checked on the blockchain by anyone in possession of the document.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdba40e17060e5a827371_1_HNKpPgvgPXI_D_gmdBYzXA.png)

**How do signatures work?**
---------------------------

The signature feature on Proxeus allows to request and record cryptographic signatures of a document hash using the Ethereum identity associated with a Proxeus platform user account. These signatures are recorded in the platform’s Registry Smart Contract.

Once the workflow execution is completed and the hash has been added to the Blockchain Registry, the finalized document can be accessed from the “Documents” tab in the frontend view of the Proxeus platform.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdbbdc9fe844ae49c6d8d_1*JZz6QI8iOpOQGCGAKCxSpA.png)

Users have the possibility to go beyond this default document / issuer registration and to request additional signatures from other Proxeus platform users in order to record the agreement of multiple parties on a document. The “Documents” view shows the status of all signature requests issued so far. As long as a signature request is pending, it can be cancelled by the requestor.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdbbc2089e5ee52934d8b_1*wlQAM1_ZzTxG3apPuGa9zw.png)

Users are notified of signature requests via a notification email. Requests can be accessed from the “Signature Requests” tab in the frontend view, where users can decide whether to sign the document or to reject the request. In order to give their signature, users are prompted to sign a transaction with Metamask, which will add the Ethereum identity associated with their Proxeus platform account to the Registry Smart Contract entry for the document as signatory.

**What can I do with signatures?**
----------------------------------

Signatures are an important blockchain feature and can be used to signify approval in many different ways. Depending on your use case, they can be implemented to provide a simple confirmation (such as in a review process in a company), or to give formal approval to entering a business relationship with partners or customers. But the same feature can also be used to fulfill many different use cases. Imagine for example that you are interested to build a voting mechanism: just issue a series of requests to people whom you want to give a voice to and set up a blockchain observer module to watch over the answers provided (requests confirmed or declined) — the result can be used to automatically generate a document via the Proxeus API that features the vote result and is sent to the relevant participants.

**Linking signatures with identities**
--------------------------------------

An important question users will face is: how can I know who is behind a wallet? Who is signing? If you are building prototypes, simple solutions such as publishing the wallet address on each party’s website, or having the identity confirmed on a case by case basis by a notary can do the trick. If you are looking to set up a productive system, you could look into integrating Ethereum Name Service or identity solutions such as uPort and more generally self-sovereign identity solutions building on the W3C DID standard.

Let us know if you are working on a use case involving signatures, especially if you are looking at creative ways to use them — we are curious to learn more and happy to assist!

‍“Our mission is to provide trusted real time data as a commodity”
=================================================================

October 17, 2019

Vlad Trifa, computer scientist, researcher and former Chief Product Officer at Ambrosus just started his new company Sensia. He is a thought leader in the fields of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Web of Things and we met him to talk about the future of these applications in which Proxeus can play a role as well.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdc3075d7b24dd5221cf5_1_bTLS-TX4XLMqn_9fp-7dYg.png)

**What are you currently working on?**
--------------------------------------

I have been with Ambrosus for the last two years. The company has been covering a wide range of solutions so we recently decided to split it into several components for better focus. Moving forward, Ambrosus will be dedicated to the blockchain backbone. The newly created company Sensia aims at providing secure IoT sensors and other hardware, building the physical environment and software to enable businesses to collect, transfer and process real world data about physical things (for example the location of a truck, the temperature of a box inside that truck, etc.) in the most reliable, transparent, secure and verifiable way. There are a lot of use cases in a variety of industries, not just logistics.

**What is your background and how did you get into IoT?**
---------------------------------------------------------

My background is engineering. After studies in machine learning and robotics at EPFL, I did a PhD at ETH Zurich on IoT. We have done a lot of research to make it easier for developers to program physical devices and even [wrote a book about Web technologies applied to IoT](https://www.manning.com/books/building-the-web-of-things). Eight years ago we built the startup [Evrythng](https://evrythng.com/) in Zurich which later moved to London. In 2016 I joined the Swisscom Digital Innovation Lab at EPFL before I was invited by Ambrosus to lead the project’s engineering and product department. It’s exciting to bring together blockchain and my expertise about making IoT programmable, accessible, secure, reliable and trustworthy.

**What are the main challenges today with IoT?**
------------------------------------------------

Firstly, it is hard today to program secure quality IoT enterprise solutions. There is a variety of devices on the market that make it very easy to get started and build a prototype. But they are not designed for building reliable, secure enterprise applications. For those, only few choices are available which are mostly complex, expensive, antique or simply full of proprietary components and security issues.

Secondly, there is a big lack of secure-by-design and blockchain-friendly sensors on the market. 99% of the data collected by sensors today are transmitted via a variety of hubs and protocols. Encryption is used for securing transmitted data, but it’s only implemented in software. Without a hardware secure element (HSM) to manage private keys and sign the data produced by the sensor on the sensor, the database, application, or business process which uses that data has no means to prove that the data is legitimate and has not been accessed or tampered by someone in between. The solution to this problem are sensors with a crypto chip attached (essentially the same technology as found on a hardware wallet) which enables the database to verify that the data it receives is not only valid (on the blockchain, not altered) but furthermore that it really comes from the device itself and not from somewhere else.

The more we can work towards making it easy to build high-quality secure IoT applications, the more companies can shift their budgets from basic R&D and testing devices to really building concrete use cases for their data, products and processes that bring business value.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdc4063723e2ef4a917f5_1*pqu-Z-3IYNzRXcan5yATkA.png)

**How will decentralized IoT networks transform supply chain management?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s take the fruit market sector as an example. Today it’s controlled by a few large companies and it’s nearly impossible for smaller businesses to enter. As a first short term shift, new technologies will enable those smaller players to reduce costs of all processes involved to a fraction of today and allows them to compete with their product because of its quality and not because of monopolies of scale.

The second, longer term vision for the next 5 to 15 years is that the physical world will get properly decentralized as well. The whole process of finding the suppliers, transporting the goods, selling them and paying for everything will be a lot more marketplace based, efficient, seamless and cheap. Think of automated Ebays for any process or operation that a business does — blockchain will enable that from a data management, match making and cost perspective. And once that’s then linked to the physical world, we have futuristic scenarios that will highly enhance the quality of supply chains and will generate new industries.

**How do you see that the Proxeus framework can play a role in IoT’s future?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of today’s processes involve the management of physical, hand written documents. All those formal paper-based documents and processes need first to be digitized and later integrated with other systems. To order products in the future, you not only need the documentation and identity of those goods on the supply chain, but also the logic around their delivery — for example you want to make sure they can move seamlessly from point A to point B (across countries and companies, etc.). This setup can be handled with smart contracts. The Proxeus framework could be leveraged here to provide solutions for a properly audited, flexible, integrated and secure smart contract infrastructure that can be integrated into the key softwares on the market.

**How do you think that the intersection between IoT, contracts and documents will evolve in the future?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Historically, most contracts involved very little physicality. But moving to smart contracts will allow accessing physical goods if the conditions for doing so have been met. For this, smart contracts not only need to have information about the real world, but they need trust in this information as well. Take the example of AirBnB and smart locks: Instead of me having to meet a person who hands me over the keys and having all the risky elements involved in this process (trust the other person, what happens if the person is not there, etc.), it could be entirely moved to IoT. Physical things like “release shipment”, “open door” or “let truck leave” can be entirely worked into smart contracts and linked to conditions — for “release shipment” for example “custom was cleared” and “the bill was paid”. So the future vision for smart contracts is about extending today’s concept to various interactions in the physical world.

**People are quite sceptical towards IoT. How would you convince them of the benefits to gain trust when it comes to security concerns?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would tell them about the potential IoT has to improve and enhance the world we are living in. One simple example are the food and medical supply chains: While they are getting more complex and technology is getting better and more efficient, we see at the same time more abuse, fraud and people getting sick because of contaminated medicine. With IoT we can change the momentum and make those processes much more secure and reliable. Another example are elderly people: Taking care of them takes a lot of time and resources, while IoT allows to automate some of those tasks and whenever something happens a reliable, trusted sensor notifies for example the family or calls an ambulance.

Of course there are many risks and challenges about privacy or people’s rights. But most of these issues arose because instead of building high quality tools, prototypes have been used. Using experience, expertise and extensive know-how to create very high quality, reliable and secure systems is the way to go. That’s a gap we are trying to bridge with Sensia by focusing on providing trusted real time data as a commodity. That would limit a lot of the abuses and risks and at the same time bring us closer to the benefits that were promised.

Proxeus: wrap your know-how digitally
=====================================

October 8, 2019

The invention of email in 1971 essentially allowed users to put letters inside a new form of envelope: a digital one. Compared to the offering of traditional postal services, this new digital envelope format not only resulted in dramatic efficiency gains (immediate delivery) and cost improvements (free distribution); over the years, it also augmented the original letter concept with new functions such as search, read receipts or auto-complete.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdc8f0e17065341827551_1_sISGIBxtNsb8ikXm5v50TA.png)

Image, video and audio content soon followed this evolution and received their own digital envelope, giving them new properties and the ability to spread much quicker. But the last wave of digitization left entire categories untouched: it took the invention of blockchains and tokens so we could understand how other elements such as money and assets could be wrapped digitally \[1\]. Proxeus participates in this evolution by offering the technology to wrap new types of elements digitally: intellectual property and know-how.

At the beginning of the Proxeus journey, a lot of the conversations we had with early users revolved around digitization in the legal space, where documents are still largely handcrafted by professionals charging an hourly rate for their service. We started thinking about solutions to scale this professional know-how. Today, it is possible to buy legal templates on different online platforms, but questions will often arise as regular consumers fill them out: what are the exact legal requirements they should observe and how should they specific points be phrased?

Instead of making mere templates available for download, owners of specialist know-how are empowered by Proxeus to create guided workflows similar to client interviews — only in digital form and automatized. Let’s take the [Swiss company registration process](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576) as an example: instead of conducting separate in-person interviews with 3 different actors (lawyer, notary, bank), all information is collected in a single flow. A series of pre-programmed checks and rules makes sure at every step that the data entered is compliant with the local laws, regulations and practices, reducing the need for human validation.

This same principle can be extended to almost every field: if you know how to certify an asset, how to issue an education diploma or how to create a tax report for crypto holdings in a specific jurisdiction, Proxeus enables you to capture this know-how in the form of workflows so you can start monetizing it (by making it available to third-parties for a fee payable in XES) or use it for any other purpose (such as increasing the efficiency of your internal processes). Now that the product is out and available to anyone on livenet, we can’t wait to discover new community-driven use cases and learn about new angles and ideas to use Proxeus, that we haven’t even thought about.

Proxeus v1.0
============

September 24, 2019

Proxeus v1.0

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d8b1c4f8c12c7a0ad3b223e_1_CiLHvbqj2Va7pRSWQ4J4YQ.png)

**IMPORTANT NOTE: To install and run your own instance of Proxeus, please follow the instructions published on** [**doc.proxeus.com**](http://doc.proxeus.com/) **and always make sure that you always pull Docker images from the official \`proxeus\` DockerHub repository and that you are using the latest version.**

Almost four years ago, we started out on a vision to make blockchain more accessible and create what the community later dubbed as the “WordPress of blockchain”. Today, we proudly announce that we now have reached an important milestone: we are releasing version 1.0 of the Proxeus software.

**ABOUT PROXEUS**
-----------------

Proxeus simplifies the development of document-centered blockchain applications by combining a powerful document automation tool with a series of blockchain functionalities. Prior to this release, we developed several prototypes showing how the framework can be used to incorporate new businesses, issue course certificates, create donation receipts, certify assets, track shipments or make anti-doping processes more secure. The functionality offered by Proxeus 1.0 will allow the community to easily recreate all of these use cases and charge for services using Proxeus tokens on livenet.

**KEY FEATURES**
----------------

The Proxeus software allows you to create a wide range of blockchain use cases by using and combining the following key functionalities:

*   Design document-centered workflow processes by connecting objects on a visual interface;
*   Create custom workflow nodes to perform all kinds of actions and connect with third-party systems;
*   Create forms to collect data;
*   Design templates and apply the data collected by forms to produce one or several documents;
*   Share workflows with third-parties for free or for a fee charged in XES;
*   Make your documents tamper-proof and easily verifiable by registering the file hash in a smart contract together with the Ethereum ID of your Proxeus account as the issuer;
*   Verify registered documents via drag & drop
*   Request signatures and approve or reject documents shared with you;
*   Extend the system capacities and start workflows automatically using the system API

**USER LEVELS**
---------------

Users can be active on three possible levels:

*   Operator: Platform administrators setting up and operating a Proxeus platform for their own purposes or in order to make it available to a set of users
*   Creator: Users with backend access that can create and modify forms, templates and workflows
*   Consumer: Users with frontend access only, i.e., able to execute workflows available to them and issue corresponding documents

**ARCHITECTURE**
----------------

We distinguish between three different application levels:

The Core is the “engine” that provides the essential functionality of any system built on top of the Proxeus technology stack. It comprises an interface (“I/O”) facilitating the connection with external applications (“extensions”) and the integration with third-party systems.

“Extensions” are smaller stand-alone applications that connect with the Core via the I/O layer. They run in combination with the Core but have no integral function that can be used by other extensions. They can be provided by Proxeus and by external contributors. The extensions are installed by Operators additionally to the Core.

“Applications” are implementations of the Core (and of any relevant extensions) that are done with the objective to fulfill the requirements of specific use cases.

**SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**
----------------------

**To install and run your own instance of Proxeus, follow the instructions published on** [**doc.proxeus.com**](http://doc.proxeus.com/)**. Always make sure that you always pull Docker images from the official \`proxeus\` DockerHub repository and that you are using the latest version.**

Once you got your own Proxeus platform up and running, head over to the [configuration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/edit#heading=h.46uk8p8upgx3) in the handbook for the final steps. After completing the power up, you can log in with your newly created root user account. We recommend to always make your first steps by connecting to the Ropsten testnet. It’s up to you if you’d like to deploy your own smart contract following our instructions or if you prefer to use our demo contract.

If that sounds like too much work and you are only interested to give it a quick try, we are running a [demo platform](https://demo.proxeus.com/) connected to the Ropsten testnet, which you can use to get familiar with Proxeus instead of deploying your own instance. Please be aware that the contents are wiped on a regular basis; be sure to check the schedule on the website in order to avoid loosing your work.

**CREATE YOUR FIRST APPLICATION USING PROXEUS**
-----------------------------------------------

Now that you have successfully installed and configured your Proxeus platform, you can start creating your first application. Make sure that you have all the [required tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/preview#heading=h.bdiacgpk9uqr) ready and dive right in following our [quick start guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/preview#heading=h.z2jx3mx52di5).

A minimal workflow comprises one template and a form to gather the data to be inserted into the document. Your workflow will automatically support the blockchain interactions required to register the output documents on Ethereum. All the concepts are explained in our [handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/preview). If you need inspiration, check out some of the use case examples on our [website](/discover).

Once you’ve built your first workflow, you can set a price (in XES tokens) for it and publish it. You’re ready to launch your first Proxeus platform!

**WHAT’S NEXT?**
----------------

The next step on the roadmap is to incorporate community feedback and release Proxeus as open source software. We are excited to see Proxeus going out into the world — now it’s your turn to test the software and give us feedback! Your contribution can play a key role in the adoption of Proxeus and XES and we can’t wait to discover new community-driven use cases and learn about new angles and ways to use Proxeus, that we may not even have thought about.

‍“It’s only a matter of sitting down and defining the processes”
===============================================================

September 18, 2019

Will the social media agency of the future use Proxeus to collect client requests and run on smart contracts? We met Gustavo Salami, founder of Kuble, to learn more about his vision.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdcf12089e5b1ea9355ec_1_enwj9_Ry_zhq1SgCDq3SfQ.jpg)

**What types of services does your agency offer?**
--------------------------------------------------

We provide services around social media from a 360° perspective for brands and people with the goal to boost their visibility and credibility on the social web. The projects involve tasks such as consulting, research, content creation, campaign management, project management or data analysis.

**What are the challenges when it comes to structuring these services?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For social media, there are little to no standards for clients and their requirements or for service providers and their deliverables. In some cases it’s difficult to structure due to the nature of creative work. But in many situations it’s just skilled work that can be broken down into deliverables. I believe that if the person or company in need of a service goes through a structured briefing process, it’s beneficial for the agency as well as for the outcomes of a project.

**Where do you see the potential for blockchain to reduce these challenges for you as an agency?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With blockchain and particularly the use of smart contracts, we can overcome the first hurdles and create trust so that both parties can rely on an agreed process.

**What are the advantages from a client’s perspective?**
--------------------------------------------------------

Giving the client the possibility to go through a structured briefing helps him to understand what he will receive at the end of a project, what the time frame is and what it costs. Escrow payments that are locked in a smart contract create security for the client as well as for the service provider.

**Could such a setup work beyond the agency business for other services as well?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. I think that wherever services are provided and standards are not clearly defined a setup with blockchain and smart contracts can be applied. It’s only a matter of sitting down and defining the processes. We might start with simple processes and later build on them.

**How can Proxeus help realize your vision?**
---------------------------------------------

I believe that Proxeus could help us to quickly prototype some key aspects of the solution and test them with our clients. The set of tools that are already in place can help us to move forward quickly without having to reinvent the wheel. It’s great to hear that the team behind Proxeus are very supportive for our idea and we’re looking forward to making the next steps.

‍“My hope is that smart contracts will really deserve their name in the future”
==============================================================================

September 4, 2019

Be it as an advisor for blockchain based projects, as a member of the Ethereum Foundation’s advisory board or with his recent talk about identity on the blockchain at TEDxLausanne — Bernd Lapp is a blockchain veteran who has been sharing his expertise for several years already. We met him to talk about his current work, his vision for the future of the industry and how he sees Proxeus contributing to the blockchain ecosystem.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdd86c9fe84cb0c9c8f24_1_FskXLUnfLD4FiCmHTI4zlw.jpg)

**What are you currently working on?**
--------------------------------------

One of my main projects is [Avado](https://ava.do/): We produce mini PCs that developers can use to run their own blockchain nodes. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero are the supported blockchains at the moment and more will be added in the future. Apart from selling the hardware, we developed an operating system as well which makes it very easy to run and maintain a node.

Another project is [relai](https://t.co/qG4DkSjL2E) which allows to make recurring investments into crypto. You link your bank account and then specify an amount and the day of the week to make the payment. Afterwards it’s converted into BTC or ETH and sent to your wallet. That’s a very convenient way to accumulate crypto currencies because it takes away the hassle and burden of doing it manually and levels out volatility.

**You are also engaged in the project Bot Latam — can you tell us more about it?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motivated by the idea that decentralized products have much more potential in developing countries than in places like Switzerland — where the legal system, the financial system etc. are working — we organized [Bot Latam](http://es.botlatam.ch/) last year. It was an onboarding tour for crypto currencies through various cities of Latin America. We focused on teaching the people how to set up their own ecosystem of crypto products rather than explaining the technical background. The tour was a great experience and we received good feedback. Especially for the tools that were used, the feedback from real users is very valuable.

**You were a member of the Ethereum advisory board — how was this experience?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I joined the board in 2015 and worked for them until the beginning of 2017. They were young and new back then and I helped to structure and organize their foundation in Zug. My main task as a board member was representing Ethereum to companies that are interested in the philosophy and potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts. For many consulting companies like PwC, E&Y, KPMG etc. that today have their own blockchain departments I was an entry point to start building their knowledge base.

**What’s your vision for the intersection of documents and smart contracts?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My hope is that smart contracts will really deserve their name in the future: A document providing information that it receives from various sources and that enables that information to trigger functions in the document itself. Such a smart contract document would thus look quite different to what we call a document today — it will be much more versatile and active. For example when it comes to proving that I’m above 18 to buy alcohol: Instead of having to produce a document that another party has to check, the smart contract would simply give that information to the system — such a process will be much more automated.

**How do you see Proxeus and its potential contribution to the ecosystem?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proxeus is a great infrastructural piece for this new economy. Today’s internet applications would not be possible without the decades of development for the underlying infrastructure. The same case applies for the blockchain — it’s a great concept but will not work unless the infrastructure is in place. Projects like Proxeus are developing solutions that make it very easy for example to let documents interact with smart contracts and there are a lot of use cases that can be built on top of it.

**What are the main challenges for blockchain to gain broader usage and acceptance?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The biggest challenge are the huge expectations. The internet needed 40 years to become what it is now, while for the blockchain many people expect everything to be ready today. However, building the infrastructure needs time, there are many issues around scalability and security that have to be solved and we need real collaboration on standards. It will at least take another 5 to 10 years before a product might achieve mass adoption.

Some industries that looked into the technology and became aware of its immaturity are starting their own solutions — Libra is one example. Those semi-blockchains build on existing infrastructure and try to make use of some benefits of the blockchain technology. But they take a centralized approach which then eliminates almost all the good parts of the blockchain. This unwillingness to wait is a serious problem.

**What are the next big things on the blockchain that you see coming?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To make blockchains work in a productive environment, everything comes down to identity. The identity of humans, refrigerators, IoT devices etc. can be verified via blockchain with the right solutions. Thanks to the zero knowledge approach, you will be able to proof your identity without having to reveal all your private information and the result of the claim will be stored on the blockchain. And in case you move home and your address changes, you would no longer need to inform everybody about it — instead they would simply see the updated information in the system. To enable such solutions, we need to standardize the way we look at identities as well.

_Now Fernando Verboonen has taken the project to the next step and incorporated a new company,_ [_CurioInvest_](https://curioinvest.com/)_, with the purpose to tokenize classic cars. We met him to learn why he thinks that classic cars are currently a great investment opportunity — not only for car enthusiasts._

**What is CurioInvest?**
------------------------
CurioInvest is a platform that enables the issuance, distribution and management of fine collectable assets registered as security tokens. CurioInvest makes it possible for collectible assets such as fine automobiles to be registered with the regulators in a compliant way and to be represented as a token that users can acquire.

**What other collectible assets could be on the CurioInvest platform?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

At this stage, there is a strong focus on fine automobiles. But our setup is very scalable and enables diversification in the future to bring other assets to the platform such as Swiss watches or paintings for instance.

**Where are you currently on the project’s timeline?**
------------------------------------------------------

A great portion of our work focused on solving the regulatory landscape that defines security tokens. There has been a lot of discussion lately regarding the regulatory frameworks under which ICOs (and STOs) fall. It’s very important for us to have a solid start, we want users to feel safe when investing in our tokens. Two weeks ago we got the final approval from the regulators and this is a huge step not only for us but for the entire crypto space as this is a “world first” — the CurioInvest platform is a pioneer in its field. So we are ready to launch and market this innovative product across Europe.

**When will the first car be crowdsourced and the first tokens be sold?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put in a simple perspective, we crowdfund on a car level. Users come to our site and invest in a certain car buying its tokens. We are currently working on an exciting partnership and therefore we’re holding the launch of the platform until we agree on the last details of this partnership. This is expected to happen in the next weeks. Looking back, this feels so exciting: One year ago when we partnered with Proxeus this was just an idea and now it’s one step away from going live.

**Talking about Proxeus, are there current interfaces between CurioInvest and the Proxeus framework?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year we did a proof of concept using blockchain to register certificates of authenticity and conditions of investment-grade classic and exotic autos. By scanning those certificates and placing the document hash on the blockchain, we were making them verifiable, guaranteeing their originality and authenticity.

Our current platform is focusin on the tokenization of the assets and is still quite minimalistic, but in the future we see the opportunity of using Proxeus to create certified documents that can be referenced in the relevant tokenization smart contract. This step will further enhance CurioInvest’s scope and usability by adding features like integrating all the relevant documents of the classic cars.

**What is the public resonance you are receiving for CurioInvest?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We are very thankful for our community that is providing us with so much positive feedback. Earlier this year we were very fortunate to win a “Best Product Award” at a start-up competition at Crypto Lab in Zug’s Crypto Valley. As a consequence, we were invited to Korea to pitch CurioInvest on TV and made it to the top 3 finalists.

**What is the big advantage of having classic cars on the blockchain?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On one hand, we have the contractual perspective: By having every document involved in the acquisition of a classic car immutably on the blockchain, you are able to scale the process, making it safe, decreasing diligence costs and saving a lot of time: we’re reducing the process from several weeks to seconds!

On the other hand, there is the investor perspective: By tokenizing collectables like fine cars, we are providing a gateway for users to participate in the value of a car without having to own it. Our platform allows everybody to invest in an asset class that until now was an elite market only accessible to very wealthy individuals.

**Who will typically use CurioInvest?**
---------------------------------------

Our target groups are private individuals interested in classic cars and willing to invest in this asset class. And we are also getting an increased amount of attention from family offices and private banks looking for something new and unique to offer to their clients.

**Are there also incentives for wealthy collectors who actually own those cars to participate in CurioInvest?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those collectors, CurioInvest provides faster liquidity in case they want to sell a car. Adding such a car to our platform for crowdsourcing makes it much easier to sell than having to look for an individual buyer. Another use case are inheritances of cars where the heirs want to split the legacy in equal parts.

**In which markets will CurioInvest be mainly active?**
-------------------------------------------------------

In a first step we will market the product in Europe in general and especially in core markets like Germany or the UK. This will be done using a legal entity we set up in Liechtenstein. We also see increased demand from Asia and further down the road we aim at going global and to involve financial institutions to resell our product as well.

**How would you convince a layperson of CurioInvest?**
------------------------------------------------------

With the recent crypto winter and the current volatility in the space it became apparent that for crypto investors it’s very hard to diversify their portfolios without exiting the crypto space, meaning without switching to stocks, bonds etc.

At the moment, only stablecoins provide a way to diversify. In the future, investors don’t have to exit the crypto space in order to access other investment opportunities and CurioInvest is facilitating this by providing a new asset class for crypto portfolios. We are bringing a very unique asset that has provenance and historic value and lets everyone participate. On one side you are for the first time able to invest in those assets with crypto and on the other side you can participate in the price valuation of those assets. In the future, frictions to invest in the crypto space will further decrease, making it even more attractive to users.

**Where do you see CurioInvest 5 years from now?**
--------------------------------------------------

We have a very innovative roadmap with additional products that we want to bring to the market. Therefore in 5 years we see us as an established company that has gained the trust of customer, that has built an allocation of several hundred rare cars and that has opened them to the public to see them and to interact with them. We see us as an innovator, building beautiful storylines about those assets. Lines that inspire people to learn more about those cars, the designers and their stories.

**And on the investment side?**
-------------------------------

We also have the option of having tokens that not only represent one single car but a line of cars — a “Porsche line” for instance — or a coin representing a whole car collection. And on the community side we will put a lot of effort into connecting the individual user with the assets he has invested in by providing him for example with 24/7 webcam streams of the cars or by building VR applications allowing him to interact with the assets. Imagine a user logging into a video game, proofing his ownership of tokens of a certain fine car and afterwards being able to ride “his” car in the game. Or you could allow users to build virtual garages with all their cars inside.

Swiss Blockchain Hackathon 2019
===============================

June 26, 2019

We are just back from the Swiss Blockchain Hackathon held at Trust Square this week-end, the largest blockchain incubator spread across 2000 square meters in a former bank building on Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich’s main shopping street. Here are some impressions from the week-end:

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bded82089e5a915936ac6_1_LDNlN7NyctYlJmTZyQJmlQ.jpg)

‍

Impressions from the Swiss Blockchain Hackathon 2019

200 hackers from 20 countries set up camp in Zurich for three days to solve real-life challenges using blockchain in six different verticals. It was a perfect opportunity for us to meet and network with a lot of relevant technical and business experts in the space. The atmosphere at the closing ceremony was exhilarating with over 200 people doing “the wave” to celebrate the end of the challenge!

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdf032089e51b06936beb_1*JpKM16Aqs3Q_dc-wFRDnLA.jpeg)

As event partners, we made the Proxeus framework available to the participants and we were able to work with several teams and gather useful feedback. Most importantly, we made several new and valuable contacts with open-source developers who expressed interested to use Proxeus as part of their regular toolbox. Following a general introduction session to the Proxeus framework, we supported several teams to build solutions in the food and shipping space, and we will stay in touch with them as their projects move from prototypes to potential live applications.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdf0363723ec350a92576_1*CFCcFQ7NlNgjgiIdC1kkTA.jpeg)

Our own crew received an assignment in the eGovernment vertical and worked until the early morning hours exploring possibilities to enable public entities to federate the right to issue documents under their seal to individual crypto-identities, in a way that is fully decentralized & auditable. White-listing capabilities are required in a wide-range of projects and this initial research will allow us to put this topic on the roadmap.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdf0363723ed2f0a92577_0*BM6yNQ49uU7wOSOv.png)

Reflecting over the event, it is rare to be able to spend so much energy on a project in such a short timeframe and we are starting the Summer with a lot of new inputs. Overall, it was very well invested time and we were able to position Proxeus among top-tier projects and academic institutions — we will be working with more similar initiatives in the future in order to grow awareness about the framework in relevant target groups.


Proxeus Releases Decentralized Data Storage DApp Tango Reloaded
===============================================================

April 11, 2019

If you have followed us for a while, you will already be familiar with the DApp Tango Beta. Tango is a user-friendly, ground-breaking secure data storage product which empowers anyone to register, share, sign and save documents through a decentralized blockchain application.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d64edaa99c8ff8767d7c3e7_image.png)

We are now excited to announce the release of Tango Reloaded, a major update incorporating new features and improvements following extensive user testing over the last months. The difference between Tango Reloaded and traditional storage solutions, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, is that Proxeus puts the power entirely in the hands of the user.

How? The ownership and sharing rights are held by the user’s crypto-identity, the files are fully encrypted and the storage provider can be selected individually for each file based on the physical location or security grade required by data protection requirements.

Your data as secure as Fort Knox
--------------------------------

Proxeus stores the encrypted data in a secure off-chain facility, while putting advanced access controls on-chain using smart contracts.

ROCKCHAIN, the service provided by [Mount 10](https://www.mount10.ch/), is currently the exclusive storage provider, storing the data in what can best be described as a military bunker, [Fort Knox style](https://www.mount10.ch/de/mount10/swiss-fort-knox/index.html). It is Europe’s most secure data centre, with multi-level protection and servers stored deep inside the Swiss mountains.

Co-founder Antoine Verdon says: “I am very excited about Tango as its potential goes way beyond the decentralized storage of information. We allow users to truly own their data, to associate it with their crypto-identity and to control the sharing of it over a blockchain interface. It is a key piece of technology that constitutes a stepping stone for anyone interested to build blockchain products around the concept of self-sovereign identity.”

Powerful, useful features
-------------------------

The new features offer enhanced functionalities and have been defined in collaboration with several community members who gave feedback in the months following the first Tango release.

Key features include:
---------------------

*   Zero Knowledge Storage (achieved through client-side PGP encryption), meaning no one (Including the storage provider) has access to the file’s content, unless the user decides to share the file
*   Blockchain secured access management (including sharing).
*   Convenient document signing with your private key.
*   DApp Tango operates as a “pay-as-you-go” solution, meaning there is no need for a traditional subscription. The payment for individual file storage is made with Proxeus’ own cryptocurrency, XES, and is now based on the file size and the duration of storage.
*   Users can send Ether and XES straight out of their DApp wallet.
*   A notification log, so users can track activity in one place.
*   Minor bug fixes and general improvements.
*   Local Encryption Concept which improves file handling on the user’s local machine.

Extremely user-friendly
-----------------------

Thanks to new ground-breaking advancements, now literally anyone can store files and manage permissions decentrally. “Tango Reloaded is incredibly simple to use. The interface is extremely user-friendly, so anyone can use it to upload and share, sign and register documents, says Stephan Balzer, Product Manager at [BlockFactory AG](https://www.blockfactory.com/), the company that has developed the DApp for Proxeus.

Why the name Tango?
-------------------

The Proxeus team seems to have an affection for passionate dances. The name Tango was chosen as the dance represents strength and firmness, but simultaneously, a vibrant and playful energy. And you need both elements to make the technique work.

Test Tango Reloaded
-------------------

Curious? Test Tango Reloaded [here](http://beta.proxeus.com./), and check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7bgXY2yGGw&feature=youtu.be) that walks you through the simple steps to use it. There’s also a user-guide available just in case you get stuck.

When you’ve tested it, we want to hear from you! What are your favourite features? Would you like different functionalities and if so, what? [Let us know.](http://proxeus.com/)

‍“Proxeus will help to get blockchain applications adopted mainstream”
=====================================================================

March 28, 2019

We were delighted to receive a visit by one of our most proactive Proxeus followers, Patrick Eichhorn.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d64ecd5371eb7c46cf91e4c_Ptrick-Eichhorn.jpeg)

‍

Q&A with Patrick Eichhorn
-------------------------

_We were delighted to receive a visit by one of our most proactive Proxeus followers,_ [_Patrick Eichhorn_](http://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-eichhorn)_._

_The Swiss developer has been following Proxeus closely since the beginning and we had the chance to meet him recently at the office of our developer, BlockFactory AG. This is a quick Q & A from his visit here._

_Patrick has been involved in the crypto-sphere since August 2017. At that time, more and more blockchain projects were being announced every week and Patrick started noticing growing interest in the developer community about blockchain technology, which made him inspired and curious to learn more._

_Shortly after, Patrick heard about Proxeus through a friend and he participated in the token sale._

What particularly excites you about Proxeus compared to other projects?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

“There are many different aspects that make Proxeus a unique project. It consists of a team with substantial knowledge gained during years of work in various blockchain projects but also in “traditional” industries such as Finance or Logistics. In my opinion, the team is the most important asset of any project. I also particularly like the transparency of the project.”

“The path from a great idea to a real working product isn’t easy — but as far as we saw during the previous year a I am convinced that there is a great future ahead.The most important point at the moment is to give the project enough time to create that value. As token holders, we have to be patient,” says Patrick.

What were the key highlights of your last visit?
------------------------------------------------

“As we stepped in, we were warmly received by the different members of the team.

There aren’t many companies where the project followers have the opportunity to talk with one of the founders face-to-face. Antoine took the time to answer all of our questions and was very curious to hear about our thoughts of the project.”

What insights could you give to the other project followers?
------------------------------------------------------------

“Firstly, I want to tell everyone who has any doubts about the seriousness of Proxeus that the project is real and that there are actually real people working on it!

Jokes aside, we saw several very cool prototypes during our visit. One project was built on the IOTA ledger and designed in a smart way. This is a sign that the team keeps its view wide enough in order to remain blockchain-agnostic and hence embracing every possibility, whatever the underlying infrastructure.”

“One can really feel that the team members are striving to build an awesome product. They really care about their token holders and are working as hard as possible to get a product running and get that solution to people in order to derive an organic demand for the XES token. This strategy was clearly explained at the start of the project and the fact that the team holds on to this plan despite adverse market conditions is a positive sign.”

Moving forward, how do you think the project will contribute to turning blockchain applications mainstream?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“A great way to spread the word about the potential of the Proxeus framework is the hackathon that will take place this summer, organised by the Trust Square in Zurich, and where the Proxeus framework will be leveraged as one of the core technologies available to the participants. More than 200 hackers will then work with the framework in order to create mainstream applications and thus highlighting the potential of the platform.

“The project is here for the long-term and Proxeus will help to get blockchain applications to mainstream adoption.

I just would like to thank the whole team for answering all of our questions and for the great experience in your office. We wish you all the best!”

Thanks Patrick for coming by and the whole team hope to see you again soon!

Proxeus Perspectives: Alex
==========================

January 30, 2019

In this new edition of the Proxeus Perspectives series, we talked to Alex, one of the full-stack developers working on the Proxeus storage application. Alex unveils the motivations that drove him to join a blockchain project and talks about the challenges arising from working with new technologies.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d64ef02ca4f1a7787bdee75_1_PkBZFWbKCH5voBl1-YkJCg.jpg)

Hi Alex! When did you first hear about blockchain and how did you become interested in this technology?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I first heard about blockchain back in 2017 when there was a lot of hype around bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I was very curious to find out why so many people were excited about this new technology, and therefore, I started to read various whitepapers. Quickly I became fascinated by the potential of blockchain technology and spent much time studying every aspect and nuance of this technology, such as game-theory, governance, decentralization, scaling and so on. At this point, I was convinced that I wanted to work in this field, so I resigned from my former job and started to learn how to implement smart-contracts with solidity.

What is the particular use case that interests you most with the blockchain technology?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lately, everybody has been asking what will be the blockchain’s killer app. In my opinion, trustless programmable money is a fascinating use case and could very much be the killer app. Currently, we see many companies just putting existing apps on the blockchain without any real added value. I’m particularly interested in applications where the blockchain solves a security, governance or censorship problem. For example, the Proxeus storage DApp has a decentralized file access management on a smart-contract, which greatly improves the security for storing, sharing and digitally signing documents in a trustless manner.

On what type of projects have you worked prior to joining the Proxeus project?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directly after finishing my bachelor studies in Software Engineering, I worked for the Zurich University of Applied Sciences on complex simulations to increase road-traffic efficiency. I’ve also worked as a Web-Developer implementing various medium to large scale web applications.

What is your favourite thing about being involved in the Proxeus project?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Proxeus we are building software at the edge of innovation and the team is continuously learning new concepts and aspects of the blockchain technology. What I particularly like about the Proxeus platform is that we are building a new technology stack and a set of standards which have the potential to change the whole blockchain development environment.

How is it to work as a developer using new technologies such as blockchain?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a software developer, it’s exciting to work on new technology. It is at the same time fascinating and challenging to wrap your head around the new blockchain-paradigma and come up with great technical solutions. As a developer, you need to keep up with the newest developments in this space on a daily basis.

What particular challenges does this imply?
-------------------------------------------

The most complex and exciting challenges are those that have no precedent and no best-practice yet, due to blockchain being such a new technology. This situation leads to interesting conversations between team members and to the drawing of new solutions. To me, it feels like having a front-row seat witnessing as well as contributing to the upcoming blockchain-world.

Interview with Guido Zeller
===========================

December 19, 2018

We talked to Guido Zeller, a developer who has been using the Proxeus framework to develop various applications and also presented his work at the University of Lucerne.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d64ec39371eb75653f91d43_Workflow.png)

**Who are you and how did you learn about the Proxeus project?**
----------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Guido and I am active in the Business Integration field. I was looking for quite some time for a platform to extend classic workflows to blockchain applications. Meeting Antoine and Patrick, and hearing about their project at a Crypto Valley Association event, was an impressive experience. I then immediately started to develop my own applications on the Proxeus project.

**Could you tell us more about the use-cases that you developed on the Proxeus framework?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started to use the workflow builder and document generator in order to easily prove the authenticity of a learning certificate and therefore eliminate the administrative overhead of this lengthy process. I then focused on other use-cases, such as creating certificates for goods of value or leveraging digital signature in order to improve the coordination of several parties within a complex process.

**What impressed you most about the application?**
--------------------------------------------------

The flexibility of the Document Generator is very impressive. I particularly liked the way how you can activate fields depending on specific content.

**Any other pieces of advice to our followers?**
------------------------------------------------

The ability to create dynamic forms is a strength — it is very interesting and useful to explore. Above all, the framework provides simplicity in the usually complicated processes that are workflows.


Proxeus Workshop: Issue a blockchain-based watch certificate in less than 30 minutes
====================================================================================

December 5, 2018

Last Tuesday, the Proxeus framework was leveraged as part of the ProConcept UserDay in order to create a blockchain-based watch certificate in less than 30 minutes.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bdfa02089e52df493722a_0_QB4KTAc5EuQhtjXo.jpg)

Back in July, we released our first beta, named “Rumba”, which allows anyone to register just any types of documents on the blockchain through pre-generated workflows and forms. This beta, openly available [here](https://beta-app.proxeus.com/), makes it easy to issue and verify the authenticity of any documents in a matter of minutes. Hence, we accepted and successfully completed the challenge to create a digital, blockchain-based watch certificate in less than 30 minutes as part of the ProConcept UserDay organized in Bern.

Once again, this successful use-case demonstrates the power of the Proxeus framework, which can already be used to remove the complexity inherent to the development of blockchain applications, in particular in use-cases related to the certification of documents. By providing a series of building blocks, the application allows users to focus on the added-value of their product, instead of spending time on basic technological challenges that dozens of others have already solved before. The platform is extremely easy to use and empowers anyone to create blockchain applications that are affordable and can be made compatible with current enterprise systems.

At the end of the experiment, two different documents were issued: an authentic certificate, and a copy that we altered by changing the serial number of the watch. The two documents can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xph_NlH3XiiPpY0GQ5uKpq1I7gEHwE-d).

Give it a try: download the documents and visit the [verification page](https://beta-app.proxeus.com/) in the beta section of the website. Can you recognize which certificate is authentic, and which one has been altered? Let us know if you do!

Certificate of Attendance — Blockchain Leadership Summit
========================================================

November 21, 2018

We are glad to announce that the Proxeus platform will be used to issue certificates of attendance as part of the Blockchain Leadership Summit 2018, the largest blockchain event in Switzerland. The conference that will be held at the Congress Center Basel on November 23 and 24, will welcome more than 2,500 attendees from all over the world.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d64eb319093d70a3dc47444_Blockchain-Leadership-Summit.jpg)

After successfully creating certificates for the graduates of the “Bitcoin, Blockchain & Crypto-assets” course at the University of Basel back in September, we are taking the Proxeus technology a step further and are testing how to handle a large number of documents in a live context.

These certificates will be created from the attendees’ basic personal information (first name, last name & company name). The documents will then be shared via e-mail with the attendees, who will instantaneously be able to verify the authenticity of their certificate of attendance through a web-based verification engine.

This step paves the way to issuing event tickets connected to a crypto-identity, that the owner holds in their self-sovereign identity solution and can decide to share with relevant parties, such as partners making special offers available in connection to the event (reduction on room rates, discounted transport tickets, etc.).

Are you attending the event and do you want to receive your own blockchain-registered certificate of attendance from the Blockchain Leadership Summit? You can do so by coming to the BlockFactory booth at the Summit. Looking forward to seeing you there!


Proxeus Perspectives: Stephan
=============================

October 31, 2018

This week we talked to Stephan, our Junior Digitization Manager. He discusses his experiences in the blockchain world, his role in the Proxeus project as well as his favorite moments since joining the adventure.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5be017512f4e69fba8a6be_1_9D8BSnZO09XSVofo0DAIEQ.png)

**How long have you been working in crypto?**
---------------------------------------------

**‍**Since the 1st of June, 2018. However, I have been interested in crypto for quite a while. I first learned about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies around November 2016, when I watched the Netflix documentaries “Deep Web” and “Banking on Bitcoin”.

**What did you do before and what made you want to work in the blockchain industry?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‍**I have had a wide variety of jobs. I have worked as a software developer for one of Switzerland’s main bank and in online marketing. Most recently, I graduated from Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School (Dublin, Ireland) with a Master’s degree in International Management. My previous jobs have something in common as they were all in the tech industry. Combining this interest for tech with my passion for innovation and disruption, it became clear to me that I wanted to find a job in the blockchain industry.

**What’s your favorite thing about working in blockchain?**
-----------------------------------------------------------

**‍**The potential and ambiguity. The state of blockchain technology is often compared to the beginnings of the Internet. While there are endless possibilities, there is also a lot of uncertainty, which has to be managed accordingly.

**What do you think of the Proxeus project?**
---------------------------------------------

**‍**When I first learned about the Proxeus project, I was blown away by its flexibility and ingenuity. Only in a few minutes, I could already think of at least five interesting use-cases. The team is currently working very hard to deliver on the promises of the white paper. Once this is done, people will see the true potential of the Proxeus platform.

**What would be your favorite use case that could be done with the Proxeus technology?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‍**To me it is groundbreaking that the Proxeus technology enables users to create tamper-proof documents with very little effort. This opens up a world of possibilities in terms of certification of assets. These assets can be simple diplomas and documents but they can also be art, watches, designer clothes or even cars.

**What does a Digitization Manager actually do?**
-------------------------------------------------

**‍**A digitization manager is responsible for replicating existing business processes on the Proxeus platform. This includes building workflows, designing templates and creating forms. Further, I am testing the internal applications, which the developers are releasing.

**What’s your favourite story from the project?**
-------------------------------------------------

**‍**This has to be the release of the first beta. The evening before the release date we stumbled upon a technical bug. This problem was almost impossible to spot during our test runs, but after the release, it would have had negatively affected the user experience. During this moment, I felt that the whole team pulled together to fix the bug, before to test the improved product and met the tight deadline. Something that seemed almost impossible at first was achieved through team effort and hard work.

**Have you tested the beta?**
-----------------------------

**‍**As a digitization manager, I am using the beta on a daily basis and I am heavily involved in its testing and quality assurance — so yes! :)

‍Building better technology
==========================

September 26, 2018

Just because a technology is good, doesn’t mean it will be adopted. It needs to be accessible and easy enough to use that the average user is willing to convert from their traditional, familiar way of doing things. Proxeus aims to do for blockchain what WordPress did for websites — take it out of the realm of the specialist and put the power right in the hands of the average user.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d64ea46371eb760e4f91032_puzzle.jpg)

To do this means simplifying everything about it — turning what used to require coding into a simple drag-and-drop UI. Proxeus’ first two betas show how this will be realized — by making the blockchain invisible and giving the user a familiar interface that lets them focus on their work.

“We’re very proud of the flexibility of Proxeus” said cofounder Antoine Verdon. “We are really changing the way people work, and how data is stored and managed. The Proxeus framework can be used to create fully GDPR-compliant blockchain products and store customer data, information from official registers, or DNA records.”

The first beta — codenamed Rumba — demonstrated the workflow engine and document generator, which had already been used in several test cases with partners like the Cantonal Government of Zug, WWF Switzerland, and the University of Basel. In fact, the University of Basel’s diploma registration and verification system was launched on mainnet September 19, making it the first real-world application of Proxeus technology.

Tango, the second beta, is a revolutionary tool for data management. Through the Proxeus DApp, users are able to have total control over their digital identity by storing their data off-chain, encrypted and secured in the storage provider of their choice, while putting detailed, granular access controls on-chain using smart contracts.

“The interface is similar to Dropbox, and it is available on Mac, Linux and PC,” said cofounder Patrick Allemann. “Currently, the documents are stored by Mount10, a storage facility located in the Swiss mountains. We will be adding more storage providers over time.”

This offers users exceptional security and control over their data, and the flexibility to share and collaborate as easily as they would with DropBox or Google Drive. However, unlike conventional solutions, Proxeus requires no subscription and there are no intermediaries and no risk of international data copying between clouds or data mining.

**So, what’s next?  
**“In the past six months we have demonstrated the key aspects of our technology: the workflow manager, document registration, and document storage,” said Verdon. “We will be adding more features and putting all those pieces together into the open source product outlined in our whitepaper, then releasing it as soon as possible for developers to build their own blockchain applications.”

Swiss University certificates turn tamper-proof thanks to blockchain
====================================================================

September 20, 2018

Yesterday, all 126 students passing the “Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptoassets” course of the University of Basel received certificates registered on the Ethereum mainnet blockchain. This marked the first time that a university in Switzerland secured the authenticity and integrity of an academic certificate on a blockchain, and an important milestone for Proxeus as its first product went live just over half a year after its successful ICO.

“This blockchain solution developed in cooperation with [Proxeus](https://proxeus.com/en/) greatly improves the process of verifying documents and represents an important step towards forgery-proof academic certificates,” said Prof. Dr. Fabian Schär, Managing Director of the Center for Innovative Finance. “Two tools have been created — one that the university staff can use to create the certificate and register it to the blockchain with its unique hash, and a second, [public tool](https://cif.unibas.ch/en/eventsprojects/certificates/)which allows anyone to verify that the electronic document has been issued by the university.”

The benefits of these tools are immediately apparent. The first, and most obvious benefit is to students, employers and the university itself — by reducing the potential for academic fraud, the secured diplomas raise the value of their credentials accordingly. “Fraud is a problem in academia just as it is in any field,” indicated Prof. Dr. Fabian Schär. “By registering credentials on an immutable, decentralized ledger, we provide an extra layer of security for graduates and potential employers. These credentials can’t be faked, and can be easily verified online. It will introduce a new paradigm of security and offer value to all parties.”

The second benefit is perhaps less visible, but carries far more economic weight. The new technology offers clear efficiency advantages compared to the previous effort required to check course certificates. Previously, the university had to be contacted directly and first had to obtain the permission of the graduate concerned before handing over the relevant information — a process that took, on average, about 90 minutes per request. By allowing web-based verification of the diplomas, the Proxeus technology minimizes the amount of effort required by potential employers to validate the credentials, and greatly reduces the amount of time required by the university to check and confirm the information when requested.

“Everyone involved benefits from this approach,” said Schär. “Employers can easily check diplomas and educational institutions minimize the risk of damage to their reputation. Perhaps most importantly, the graduates themselves benefit from greater credibility, which increases the standing of their alma mater.”

Don’t just take our word for it — you can try if for yourself and see if you can fake a certificate! [Download the test certificate](https://cif.unibas.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/cif/certificate_valid.pdf), and [check it here](https://cif.unibas.ch/de/eventsprojekte/zertifikate/). Then, try editing or altering the certificate and check it again. Within seconds, you’ll see that the certificates can’t be faked, no matter how hard you try!

‍Who’s behind Proxeus?
=====================

August 22, 2018

Many of the questions we get are related to the relationship between Proxeus Est. and BlockFactory AG (Ltd.). It seems that a lot of people have difficulty understanding not only what the two entities are and what they each do, but also how they related to each other. I would like to shed some light on this.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5d5ffcafa7638fedc0519e0d_Vaduz.jpeg)

Proxeus is a non-profit establishment which has its domicile in the beautiful city of Vaduz in Lichtenstein. This entity is responsible for managing all aspects of the Proxeus project, in order to build up Proxeus technology as well as the ecosystem around the XES token according to the Proxeus white paper.

BlockFactory is a profit-orientated limited company registered in the bucolic city of Zug, at the heart of Switzerland’s Crypto Valley. Proxeus mandated BlockFactory — which is specialised in blockchain solutions — to fulfil the Proxeus product suite as stated in the whitepaper.

From a formal perspective, Proxeus is the client, and BlockFactory the service provider.

The confusion mostly comes less from a missing formal separation, but instead because some of BlockFactory’s staff fulfil representative functions at Proxeus. Antoine Verdon, for instance, is in fact one of the cofounders of Proxeus and represents the Proxeus technology accordingly. In the media, he was sometimes represented as “Head of Proxeus” — which isn’t factually accurate. He is CEO of BlockFactory and has no legal role within the Proxeus establishment, which is governed by an independent board.

This separation of roles is deliberate and carefully considered. It ensures impartiality of decision making, proper financial diligence, and no conflicts of interest. In the end, it’s an illustration of the old English expression “Good fences make good neighbours.” Clarity about who does what makes us all work together more effectively, and achieve what we all want — the successful fulfilment of the Proxeus whitepaper.
