_We are proud to announce that we have reached an important milestone: the Proxeus software has reached v1.1 and has been open sourced under a GNU GPLv3 license. Set up your own Proxeus instance and create your first application today!_

## ABOUT PROXEUS

Just like Wordpress empowered companies and enthusiasts to create websites without starting from a blank page at the beginning of the Internet, Proxeus aims to make blockchain technology more accessible by shortening the time necessary to create and test document-oriented use cases. The Proxeus software is a powerful workflow engine, allowing users without specific programming skills to digitize complex document templates, connect them to a business logic and make them available to third-parties on a web-based portal — for free or for a fee.

Since the [v1 release](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-v1-0-32144b628349) in September, several improvements have been made to implement the community feedback, as well as the recommendations received through a series of product, technical, legal and security audit rounds. The application comes with a better solution to implement custom nodes and a series of [UI improvements](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-design-update-have-a-look-at-our-improved-user-interface-d92af28b1ee9).

**SET UP PROXEUS**

**Step 1:** To install and run your own instance of Proxeus, follow the instructions published on [doc.proxeus.com](http://doc.proxeus.com/#/). Always make sure that you always pull Docker images from the official \`proxeus\` DockerHub repository and that you are using the latest version.

**Step 2:** Once your Proxeus platform is up and running, head over to the [configuration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/edit) in the handbook and follow the configuration steps. After completing the power up, you can log in with your newly created root user account. We recommend you always start by connecting to the Ropsten testnet and test your applications extensively.

**Step 3:** Deploy your own Proxeus smart contract following the instructions you will find in the documentation, or if you prefer, use our demo contract.

_If you are only interested to give Proxeus a quick try, we are running_ [_a demo platform_](https://demo.proxeus.com/) _connected to the Ropsten testnet, which you can use to get familiar with Proxeus instead of deploying your own instance. Please be aware that this platform is only available for demo purposes and the data is therefore being wiped on a regular basis: make sure to check the schedule published on the Proxeus website in order to avoid losing your work._

**CREATE YOUR FIRST APPLICATION**

Now that you have successfully installed and configured your Proxeus platform, you can start creating your first application. A minimal workflow comprises one template and a form to gather the data to be inserted into the document.

There are vast possibilities to use Proxeus that require zero programming. Proxeus “out of the box” is a powerful document automation platform with blockchain capabilities. You can customize the platform to your liking: place your own logo, change any text label or add multi-language support. You can configure workflows with intuitive, dynamic user forms by using the drag & drop editors.

Once your first workflow is ready, you can decide to keep it for yourself or to make it available to third-parties. For that go to the workflow workspace, set a price (in XES tokens) and click on the publish button: your workflow will become accessible to other users and you will receive a fee in XES tokens each time a workflow execution is purchased.

**EXTEND PROXEUS**

External nodes is an extension system allowing technical users to add functionality to their workflows without touching the Proxeus Core application. You can install extensions provided by the community without writing any code — or decide to create your own. If you are running your own software product, you could for example build an external node allowing Proxeus platform Operators to give their users direct access to your product. Learn more about external nodes on the [developers page](https://www.proxeus.com/developers).

**ACCESS AND MODIFY THE OPEN SOURCE CODE**

Users with software development skills have even more comprehensive ways to customize the software. Be it for your own needs or as a contributor to the Proxeus open source community, you can deep dive into the application’s inner workings.

Proxeus is completely open source and the full code and documentation for all of the elements of the Proxeus framework has been released on the [official Proxeus GitHub account](https://github.com/ProxeusApp) repositories. where you will find:

*   Proxeus Core — the main application for creating and running workflows
*   Document Service — the service that renders templates into PDFs and DOCX
*   ProxeusFS — an example Proxeus smart contract

**GET INSPIRED**

Prior to this release, we developed several prototypes showing how the framework can be used to incorporate new businesses, issue course certificates, create donation receipts, certify assets, track shipments or make anti-doping processes more secure — those examples are detailed on a dedicated section of the [website](http://www.proxeus.com/discover). We also created two additional application examples as additional inspiration to the community and demonstrate how workflows can be monetized using XES: a tax reporting tool for crypto assets and a proof of prior existence workflow. Both come with full code and documentation and are deployed on the demo platform.

**A WORD OF CAUTION**

The Proxeus software has undergone a series of audits before its open source release. Despite all precautions, users should not postulate that all security-relevant issues have been identified. In fact, the assumption must be made that there will be more bugs. You are using the Proxeus software or any code from its GitHub repositories at your own risk. If you decide to use the Proxeus software, do your own research and be sure to have read and understood the documentation beforehand. You are encouraged to thoroughly inspect the code that you will run before attempting to do anything.

**BECOME A CONTRIBUTOR**

The open source community is a huge worldwide movement with countless brilliant minds, and we are convinced that external contributors can have an immense impact on the Proxeus software going forward: some will hunt bugs and contribute to increase the security for everyone. Others will make suggestions for improvements or for whole new features. Business-minded people will come up with new use cases and concepts for industry-specific applications. Creative minds will contribute to further improve the user interface and to upgrade the user experience. Open source communities are incredibly resourceful — passion for good software, curiosity for new ideas and the joy of achieving something together are great motivators.

How about you? If you feel that you could contribute something and want to put your own mark on the project, the Proxeus community will be more than happy to welcome you. Make sure to follow our [Twitter updates](https://twitter.com/proxeusapp) and get in touch with us about possibilities to contribute in the future.

Every Ending is a new Beginning
===============================

June 9, 2020

With the open sourcing of Proxeus, Proxeus Anstalt has achieved the mission it was entrusted with by the token holder community and will be winded down, while Proxeus will be becoming a community-run project.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5edfb6fc58665539b2ee7269_1_63NaTJucm9sATOSpX2JQ9Q.jpg)

_In September 2019, we announced the delivery of Proxeus v1 offering anyone the possibility to install and run an instance of Proxeus making transactions on livenet. Since then, several improvements have been made to implement recommendations received through a series of functional and technical audit rounds, and integrate community feedback. Today, Proxeus Anstalt has published v1.1 of the Proxeus framework as open source software. With this step, Proxeus Anstalt has achieved the mission it was entrusted with by the token holder community and will be winded down, while Proxeus will be becoming a community-run project._

**Why Proxeus?**

By enabling trust to be established algorithmically without a need for the counterparties of a business transaction to know each other, blockchain technology creates new framework conditions allowing innovative business models to emerge. Yet blockchain is largely uncharted territory and the technological and financial barriers to create those new models are still high. Just like Wordpress empowered companies and enthusiasts to create websites without starting from a blank page at the beginning of the Internet, the Proxeus project was started to make blockchain technology more accessible and shorten the time necessary to create and test document-oriented blockchain use cases. In essence, the framework can be seen as a bridge connecting two worlds and allowing on the one hand individuals and businesses to digitize traditional processes and register information on a blockchain, and on the other one to make blockchain activity visible by generating human-readable documents.

**From vision to product**

Following a successful Token Generating Event and as per the project whitepaper, Proxeus appointed BlockFactory AG, a software development company based in Zug, Switzerland, to develop a software solution corresponding to the requirements outlined in the Proxeus whitepaper document. BlockFactory set out to tackle this objective by scoping the project alongside the following main pillars and principles:

**Software architecture**: Proxeus should have a strong foundation to allow community projects to scale. The key technology choices were made in anticipation of the future needs. The product architecture was analyzed and improved with a special focus on the compatibility of Proxeus with external systems, thereby maximizing the chances of adoption of the product by the developer community.

**User needs and requirements**: What functionality does the community expect? In order to put the whitepaper ideas into context and receive direct user feedback at different steps along the way, BlockFactory worked with external partners to develop a series of projects using the Proxeus technology stack in various contexts. The engineering team made the Proxeus code available in the context of events such as hackathons, allowing to gather input from developers with various backgrounds, and calls for community feedback were launched upon reaching key milestones.

**Usability**: Do the features and functions support the Proxeus mission to make blockchain more easily accessible? Poor user experience is currently one of the key reasons for the lack of adoption of blockchain technology by the wider public. Usability was a key principle in the product decisions made along the way and led us to deliver Proxeus as a hosted platform allowing its operators to make the best of two worlds — combining decentralized identities, payments and other blockchain capabilities with the advantages of operating a system in a server or cloud environment. This setup reduces adoption barriers and removes distribution challenges.

Over the past two years, BlockFactory worked with industry partners on projects using the Proxeus technology stack in various contexts: from [speeding up the incorporation of Swiss companies](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576) to [tokenizing a supercar](https://medium.com/proxeus/blockchain-enables-investing-in-classic-cars-for-everybody-not-just-millionaires-5e9dec740aee), demonstrating a [track-and-trace solution](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-technology-enables-shipment-tracking-system-based-on-iota-91484c503978) for the logistics space, [making university diplomas tamper-proof](/blog-posts/swiss-university-certificates-turn-tamper-proof-thanks-to-blockchain) or [improving anti-doping processes](/blog-posts/bringing-blockchain-to-the-anti-doping-world). This inflow of requirements based on concrete user needs constituted an important help for concretizing the architecture, scope and functionalities of the solution. Several of those initiatives also received international recognition and media coverage, creating global awareness for Proxeus and inspiring community members to prototype and test their own ideas.

In addition to community validation, the solution delivered today as open-source software has been audited by a series of independent product, technical, legal and security experts, and several rounds of improvements took place to implement their recommendations. The final feedback we received from Old School GmbH, a specialised consultancy based in Crypto Valley who reviewed the product functionality, made us very proud: according to its founder Bernd Lapp, “the Proxeus software was not only built with all key functionality originally promised, it also includes a series of useful additions and the product stands out as very intuitive and visually attractive. Proxeus contributes to the credibility of the blockchain space as a whole and we hope to see more projects release a valuable product in the future.”

**What comes next: towards a decentralized governance**

Proxeus was designed as a community initiative from the start and as the software is being open sourced, its further development will be driven by its users. A new not-for-profit body aiming to maintain and develop the Proxeus software going forward — Proxeus Association — was recently created by a group of trusted and committed community members. Proxeus Association aims to set up a decentralized governance structure enabling the global stakeholder community to take influence on future developments, and will take over the management of all communication channels (social media, blog, website) from this point on.

**Thank you**

Proxeus was set up with a mission to enable anyone to create document-centered applications leveraging the blockchain. Moving from a visionary whitepaper to a concrete software product was a long road consisting of many challenges and breakthroughs. We faced strong headwinds and battled our way through deep crypto winter. We had to revise our assumptions several times along the way and we inevitably made a few wrong decisions, but setbacks have also made us stronger: we had a lot of amazing successes and the team showed extraordinary dedication to bring the project to completion.

We would like to make a special thank you to our unique community, whose members have shown overwhelming support for the project from the start and shared their feedback and enthusiasm during good and difficult times alike. It’s been fascinating to watch the Proxeus project gradually take its own dynamic, covering use cases going even beyond the possibilities that we had in mind when the project started. It is still early days and the Proxeus ecosystem has only started to grow. As the code is handed over to the community, this toolbox will serve a growing number of individuals and organizations interested to explore the possibilities offered at the intersection of document workflows and decentralized ledgers.

Thank you also to our partners, in particular to the BlockFactory team, who oversaw the technical aspects of the project and worked extremely hard to build the product and has seen things to the very end. Many of the project members will continue supporting Proxeus in various roles after a much-needed break and we can’t wait to see what new ideas will come to life over the coming years. The journey to large-scale blockchain adoption is still a long one and we are the first to recognize that it is only beginning, but with the Proxeus v1.1 release, we just contributed our part towards this vision.

Introducing Proxeus Open Source Association
===========================================

June 9, 2020

On June 9, 2020, Proxeus Anstalt announced that following completion of the goals set at the occasion of the Proxeus TGE in February 2018, it will step down from its role of developer and maintainer of the Proxeus framework. This post addresses the question of maintenance and future developments relating to the Proxeus framework going forward.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5edfbcc97e92241b7cb7fe55_Proxeus%20Association.png)

_On June 9, 2020, Proxeus Anstalt_ [_announced_](https://medium.com/proxeus/every-ending-is-a-new-beginning-a5bffeb890a9) _that following completion of the goals set at the occasion of the Proxeus TGE in February 2018, it will step down from its role of developer and maintainer of the Proxeus framework. This post addresses the question of maintenance and future developments relating to the Proxeus framework going forward._

**Our vision**

Decentralized technologies create new framework conditions allowing innovative business models to emerge. Yet a lot of blockchain ideas stay stuck in the heads of entrepreneurs because the technological and financial barriers to create them are too high. Web development has seen a “no code” revolution over the last decade, with new tools — such as the blogging and content management software WordPress — leading to the creation of a lot of value for society at large. We want to participate to the democratization of blockchain applications.

**About us**

A group of people with deep expertise in software and open source technologies, who believe that Proxeus is a valuable framework with potential to gain broader acceptance. As maintenance and further development of the software is reliant on the existence of an active community of users, we have set ourselves the mission to establish a governing body for Proxeus with the following objectives:

*   Set up community governance mechanisms using the XES token
*   Maintain and develop the Proxeus framework
*   Foster innovation and increase framework attractiveness
*   Develop long term funding sources for the Proxeus framework

Proxeus Anstalt — the organization that set up the Proxeus TGE in 2018 — has announced the completion of its mission and will be winded down. As part of this process, Proxeus Association has been tasked with the responsibility for a series of key aspects of the project, such as ownership of the source code license, ownership of the project’s source code repositories, governance of the XES reserve and management of the Proxeus communication channels, and has been provided with funding to execute its vision.

**Project Roadmap**

We have high ambitions for Proxeus and we have set out to work on four tracks: product, community, governance and funding. We are currently working on giving visibility and transparency to the activities planned for the next project phase.

**_Product_  
**Proxeus Association compensates maintainers and incentivizes contributors to the Proxeus framework. We allocate resources based on the defined roadmap and scheduled improvements. We post bounties and associate a reward to the development of specific desired features, or accept improvements proposed by external developers.

**_Community_**  
We launch and support community initiatives, and we create synergies and partner with relevant community-driven projects. We accept funding applications from external projects. Requests are accepted for projects that aim to add a net value to the Proxeus ecosystem as a whole, and will be thoroughly reviewed.

**_Governance_**  
We endeavour to develop ways to crowdsource decisions in order to increase community involvement and create a direct alignment between the software usage and development and the interests of the token holders. DAOs are considered interesting constructs to run a decentralized governance body, and the Executive Board will work towards the vision of enabling XES holders to directly take influence on the project course.

**_Funding_**  
We strive to put the Proxeus framework on a stable long-term financial basis. In addition to the possible mechanisms a governance DAO can offer (e.g. link community engagement to XES scarcity through staking), we will be developing a series of traditional funding sources, among which the acceptance of donations and the seeking of grants connected to partnerships within the open source ecosystem.

**Initial thoughts on decentralized governance**

DAOs offer the possibility to develop a governance structure that reflects the interests of the community and translates an increase in framework usage or in community engagement into a reduction of the available token supply. The Aragon framework for example could offer the possibility to issue voting tokens to community members who decide to stake their XES for a certain period. The number of tokens issued would depend on staking duration (the longer tokens are staked, the more voting tokens would be issued proportionally) and the voting tokens can then be used by community members to take influence on strategic product/framework issues, or to validate the allocation of grants to third-party projects. In order to create a DAO vehicle that is truly aligned with the community interests, this project should however not be rushed: it should be thoroughly reflected, discussed and tested. It therefore makes sense to plan it as part of the Proxeus Association 2020 roadmap.

**How can I be involved?**

There are several ways to get involved in the activities of the Proxeus Association: at the moment we are mainly looking for deployment maintainers and a [project manager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xn1ECVIaNxxyFe9LysYm91apA1YYQsOAJNKmRNaCF-A/edit).

We are also planning to open board membership to a larger circle. More information will follow on that in the second part of the year. In order to apply, candidates to the association board will need to fulfill the following conditions:

*   Interest for the product and for advancing the long term goals of Proxeus and/or existing meaningful contribution to the Proxeus codebase
*   Evidence of high ethical standards, good reputation and compliance with the Proxeus Open Source Association statutes
*   Absence of any conflict of interest with the Proxeus vision and ecosystem

If you have built a project using the Proxeus software, we would like to know more about it and how we can help you. Please contact us at [association@proxeus.com](mailto:association@proxeus.com)

**Who is behind Proxeus Association**

Proxeus Association is a non-profit association based in Berne, Switzerland, that is entirely dedicated to the maintenance, promotion and advancement of the Proxeus framework. The association is governed by an Executive Board currently consisting of three members:

**_Oleg Lavrovsky / Community lead_**  
A professional software engineer and consultant with two decades of IT experience, Oleg works with digital and local communities to build sustainable bridges in a world increasingly dependent on data. A recognized expert in and proponent of open systems, he is a member of the board of Opendata.ch — Swiss chapter of Open Knowledge Foundation — active in various communities as coach and organizer. As co-founder of the civic tech initiative Cividi, maintainer of the open source hackathon platform Dribdat, as well as contributor to dozens of mature open source projects, Oleg will be drawing on his community building and open development experience to make Proxeus “hackable”: attractive and widely useful to developer communities.

**_Fabian Mösli / Product lead_**  
After discovering the Proxeus project at the beginning of 2018, Fabian joined BlockFactory, the Swiss software development company mandated by Proxeus Anstalt with the implementation of the project whitepaper. He was soon overseeing several product management streams and became one of the driving forces and key knowledge carriers behind the successful completion of the mandate. Fabian has now moved on to his next challenge but he is still burning with unbroken enthusiasm for DLT and decentralized applications and therefore volunteered to contribute his product knowledge to Proxeus Association, which will also allow him to stay in contact with the community.

**_Vivien Fuhrer / Admin lead_**  
Vivien is a seasoned financial expert with several years of experience in the cryptocurrency field. He will be leading the administrative aspects of Proxeus Association with the primary responsibility over the accounting. He is also actively promoting the use of the Proxeus software within Switzerland by supporting community projects and initiatives.

**Looking ahead**

We believe that Proxeus is a fantastic tool with potential to facilitate the transition to a new digital economy. As the project is starting a new phase, we are excited by the journey ahead and are committed to bringing Proxeus to the next level. Proxeus Association is here to listen to the needs and wishes of the community, drive the further development of the product and foster adoption through various initiatives. As part of the project handover from Proxeus Anstalt, we have also taken over the management of the Proxeus official communication channels — follow our updates on our [blog](https://medium.com/proxeus) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/proxeusapp) and get in touch with us!

UI update: fresh looks and a more intuitive interface
=====================================================

March 25, 2020

After the release of Proxeus 1.0 in September last year, we’ve received questions, praise and improvement suggestions from the community. Some of the feedback concerned the user experience that the application offers or specific elements of the user interface design. The product team decided to implement improvements in the user interface to give it a fresh touch before open sourcing the software. Besides the visual changes, we’ve also made it easier for our users to customize their own Proxeus platforms.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab54cb44a484a2a6c2483_1_XGrhabWoYgNfEYdqk95cRw.png)

After the release of [Proxeus 1.0](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-v1-0-32144b628349) in September last year, we’ve received questions, praise and improvement suggestions from the community. Some of the feedback concerned the user experience that the application offers or specific elements of the user interface design.

The product team decided to implement improvements in the user interface to give it a fresh touch before open sourcing the software. Besides the visual changes, we’ve also made it easier for our users to customize their own Proxeus platforms.

If you’ve been an avid user of the platform before, you’ll certainly notice immediately that the way we’re displaying lists — your workflows, forms and templates — has been cleaned up to give you a much better overview of your elements and the available actions.

Another change that might stand out is that we’ve reorganized the menus. The most important buttons are now much easier to locate and all the other options won’t distract you any longer. We even got rid of the big old round button in the bottom right corner!

Other improvements comprise the introduction of a new main font, a few changes to the color palette, and an easy way to integrate your own logo. In the translations section, you’ll find an entry “Logo url” where you simply add the path to your logo. You can even choose a separate logo for each language.

Overall we believe that we’ve found a balanced approach to fulfil your change requests without changing the user interface so much that you have to relearn everything. The simpler design and more intuitive arrangement should give all users a better experience.

Below we share some before–after screenshots to give you an idea of the new user experience!

Let the Proxeus community know what you think and what you would change… it might just happen! Besides, Proxeus is now open-sourced completely, so you’ll be able make changes yourself, too!

– –

**Lists**

Lists have been redesigned to provide a better overview. The buttons are no longer just icons, but their function is spelled out. We’ve also replaced the round green “plus” button for creating new elements; it’s now above the list instead of hiding in the bottom right corner.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab4d55a8a0e7a1260874f_1*_CbRM5LlHyTtDk7omIUAPA.png)

**Workflows**

When editing elements such as workflows, it’s quite clear that the old UI just got more and more functions, leading to four “main” buttons dominating the view. We’ve reworked that to highlight only the two key actions.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab4d51489093b17f980a7_1*wdQ22GgglV0vhQiDnorLeg.png)

**Dropdowns**

Other elements such as dropdown menus have been revisited, too. It’s now much easier to find the right list item.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab4d5a453150bf0f4d4da_1*Q2GSFrEhz50-p7md6bxjgQ.png)

**Templates**

The previously cluttered template preview window has been cleaned up and helps you keep an overview of all your template versions even if your platform has several activated languages.

**Form editor**

The form editor has been revamped, too. The key actions are now all next to each other and the Save button is highlighted.

Proxeus & Hyperledger: Combining powers
=======================================

March 17, 2020

Proxeus made history by helping to speed up company incorporations in Switzerland to under two hours (find more details here). In a previous blog post we spoke to the lawyer Philippe Kaiser from Kaiser Odermatt & Partner who is involved in the project. To provide another view on the project we asked Ulrich Schimpel, member of IBM CTO Europe Team, about his thoughts and experiences.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5ebab47e89da3c4e94f0bcf4_1_OgRRWozwu9uNGoTBHCQScg.jpg)

_Proxeus made history by helping to speed up company incorporations in Switzerland to under two hours (find more details_ [_here_](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/swiss-using-blockchain-to-refine-clunky-business-incorporation-2018-5)_). In a_ [_previous blog post_](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576) _we spoke to the lawyer Philippe Kaiser from Kaiser Odermatt & Partner who is involved in the project. To provide another view on the project we asked Ulrich Schimpel, member of IBM CTO Europe Team, about his thoughts and experiences._

**Can you tell us more about the company register project and its objectives?**

The project is about an end-to-end acceleration when you are founding a Swiss company. It’s not about replacing any party involved in such a process but it brings together all the pieces that are needed including notaries, banks and the commercial registrar. The objective is clearly to speed up the founding process to a few days compared to several weeks and to have a much better transparency across different players.

**You set a new record by founding the first Swiss company on the blockchain in under 100 minutes, instead of the usual 10 days. How did you achieve that?**

We did this experiment as a realistic fire drill to find the limit of this process. This means, everyone involved was informed but we did not know the name of the company to be founded. It was only when the jury actually chose a name that we were able to start the process, fill in all the information and have the correct name in the files, for example, to open a bank account.

This experiment was very insightful because it showed us that founding a company was possible in under two hours and the delays will hopefully be reduced step by step in the future. We achieved this result not by revolutionizing the entire process but by cleverly combining different components: Of course, we used digitization but we also reused existing, already very well working infrastructure and our job was to put these different components together. This is the main reason why we could actually achieve this impressive result.

**Why did you choose Proxeus as a core partner to start this business ecosystem?**

First of all, the Proxeus team is highly innovative, agile and engaged and perfectly fits the spirit of all other core partners. This is also true when it comes to their product: Proxeus is a highly flexible tool to pull together all relevant information in a user-friendly workflow that — in the very beginning — we did not know how it would look like. Having to define and configure this workflow including roles etc. and being able to do it in an intuitive way was very helpful. We configured Proxeus as a web solution which was a must for us, and it provides a very good user experience for the people who need to fill in the data and produce the required documents. All in all, the Proxeus platform offered a tremendous support for this pioneering initiative.

**Why did you choose to implement a Hyperledger blockchain? How did you set it up and what role does it play in the company incorporation process?**

We used a Hyperledger Fabric as a permissioned blockchain because we are working in a regulated industry environment. This requires to know the identities of the participating players and to employ flexible and role-based accessibility and visibility policies: A bank has different rights and obligations than the commercial registrar or a notary and we have to make sure that only a bank can for example issue a bank certificate and only a commercial registrar can approve a company foundation. Furthermore, we don’t need a mining process to guarantee consistency of the blockchain as the set of current and future participants like Cantons and banks offer a high standard of trustworthiness, professionality and mutual independence.

In our setup the Hyperledger fabric blockchain has a logging mechanism which makes the whole process revision-proof: You can see exactly when the bank actually approved or uploaded a certificate or when the notary actually approved that all the necessary steps for the foundation have been completed.

**How does the Hyperledger contract communicate with the Proxeus application?**

Just like everything in our joint project with the partners was very lean and agile, we implemented a very lean interface between Proxeus and the Hyperledger fabric blockchain. Information typed in or provided by the users in the Proxeus interface (e.g. name of the new company and its founders and the chosen notary) is not only filled into the documents but also transmitted to the blockchain-enabled workflow system, where it is used to dynamically set up the adequate access rights. Only involved process parties will then have the rights to access a certain foundation.

**What are your learnings from this project?**

There are two key learnings: First, regarding the lean approach I already mentioned reusing existing components, processes and infrastructures and, second, regarding the ecosystem. Like many (maybe all) industrial blockchain projects, ours depends a lot on the ecosystem of partners and how they are actually being orchestrated, how they interact and collaborate. This is an evolutionary journey which should be given sufficient attention. Technology is only one part of the project, the other part is about real processes in the real world and — in our case — with a lot of legal aspects as well. In some cases, we actually had to employ “workarounds” because of legal restrictions and in order to be fully compliant with Swiss law. Such issues make it necessary that the partners are working together efficiently, and while short communication paths must be in place, we also needed to give it necessary time to evolve at certain points. Basically, the project as a whole but also each partner needs to have sufficient time to make the necessary clarification adjustments and changes for themselves.

“We digitized over $200 billion in bonds onto the blockchain with Proxeus”
==========================================================================

March 5, 2020

From smart cities to fintech to blockchain, Global ReEnergy Holdings is busy finding best practice solutions that can shape our digital future. We sat down with its CEO, Dr. Jonathan R. Everhart, to talk about current challenges and his experiences with the Proxeus platform that his company uses for InnovativBank.

_From smart cities to fintech to blockchain,_ [_Global ReEnergy Holdings_](https://www.globalreenergyinc.com/) _is busy finding best practice solutions that can shape our digital future. We sat down with its CEO, Dr. Jonathan R. Everhart, to talk about current challenges and his experiences with the Proxeus platform that his company uses for InnovativBank._

**What is InnovativBank?**

[InnovativBank](https://www.innovativbank.com/) is a wholly-owned fintech subsidiary of ours that focuses on shaping the future of global financial markets. We use technology solutions–such as Proxeus–within the fintech arena and deploy them with institutions in the financial services industry. All current demonstrations with the Proxeus platform are operated through InnovativBank.

**What services and applications does InnovativBank provide to its clients?**

InnovativBank provides a variety of fintech solutions to financial institutions, such as smart lending, digital trade finance, and blockchain. We continuously source new fintech solutions to add to our technology portfolio and provide them to the institutions we work with.

**Who are your clients?**

Our clients are mainly B2B and B2G. We are working globally with a number of financial institutions, international financial centers, and stock exchanges to integrate our fintech solutions.

**What will the smart city of the future look like?**

Our company is involved with the United Nations Science-Policy-Business Forum. I serve on its Green Technology Advisory Board. The purpose of the forum and my role on the advisory board is to create best practices across financing, policy, and technology to accelerate sustainable digital economies around the world. In this role, we meet in different forums and high-level working groups to identify the best solutions around the globe, that–from policy, finance, and technology perspectives–have the potential to accelerate sustainable digital economies. We gather insights from cities and organizations that have successfully deployed a particular solution in one area and disseminate these best practices under the umbrella of the United Nations to other member nations, their delegates, and leaders. What governments and organizations essentially get are blueprints that help them accelerate the crafting of their own digital economy frameworks. Through this work, I see the smart city of the future to be locally customized digital ecosystems around the world–and in outer-space–where people work in tandem with technology to improve their lives and their environment.

**What are the main challenges implementing it?**

While the media is pushing and creating a lot of hyped sentiment around every sector of the digital economy–such as smart cities, blockchain, and artificial intelligence–we are still very early and barely scratching the surface. Globally, we need to continue to cultivate the best policies, financing options, and technology frameworks to invest in, and–from an operational standpoint–promote business models that can be sustained in the long-run. In order to continue accelerating the digital economy transformation, our company is going to continue to work with organizations like the United Nations and technologies like Proxeus to drive useful and commercially-viable solutions globally.

**How did you come across Proxeus?**

My team and I spend a lot of time reading and researching new solutions, opportunities, and technologies which can be added to our portfolio. We came across Proxeus in an article about the [Swiss business incorporation use case](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576). In the blockchain space, one of the biggest challenges is not only finding entities that have the technological solution, but also finding the solutions that fit within a commercially-viable use case. Our team’s extensive experience in technology, finance, and law helps us to identify such technological solutions within a specific niche that can then be deployed from a viable commercial standpoint.

**What is your first impression with the Proxeus tool?**

We started using Proxeus back in November 2019 and now, during the first quarter of 2020, we are conducting demonstrations with several financial institutions, international financial centers, and stock exchanges. Our commercial interest lies in digitizing financial instruments onto the blockchain through the Proxeus platform. Within this use case we are currently focusing on green bonds. We recently launched a $1 trillion global green bond issuance initiative through our affiliation with the United Nations Science-Policy-Business Forum. The goal of this initiative is to register $1 trillion in current and future green bonds onto the blockchain in order to increase transparency in the global green bond market, enhance the custody of green bond transaction records, and enhance the audit trail of green bond transaction records. This will assist in increasing confidence and subsequent investments in the global sustainable bond market. More importantly, it will demonstrate the commercial capabilities of blockchain on a large scale which industries worldwide are seeking to achieve. To date, we have digitized over $200 billion in exchange-listed green bonds from around the world onto the Proxeus platform. I will be showcasing this initiative at this year’s United Nations Science-Policy-Business Forum as an example of the policy and commercial work of the Forum in action. This achievement shows the commercial capabilities and benefits of using blockchain to digitize financial instruments.

Using the Proxeus platform has been very simple. It keeps its promise of being the “WordPress for blockchain.” Building out our specific templates and workflows has been a seamless process, and it works great for our demonstrations. We did not have any major issues and all technical questions were immediately answered by the support team. Proxeus has been very useful for us. We see its application globally within different industries, expanding beyond the financial services sector. For example, the Proxeus tool in commercial real estate could be used in a number of workflows to digitize real estate records. It can also be used in the intellectual property sector to digitize patent, trademark, and copyright registrations.

**Are you planning to use Proxeus for future projects as well?**

Yes, we do. The first step is to show proof-of-concepts for viable commercial use cases to institutions. This involves not only showing that blockchain works, but more importantly educating institutions on blockchain and beneficial use cases that they have not yet considered. The next step is to continue to deploy the Proxeus platform in projects with these institutions, as they see the benefits of blockchain within their operations. We definitely see the benefits of the platform and anticipate using it in the long-run.

Proxeus partners with the Swiss Blockchain Institute
====================================================

February 12, 2020

Today we proudly announce that Proxeus joined forces with the Geneva-based Swiss Blockchain Institute. The Institute will be using the Proxeus framework to issue blockchain-registered diplomas as well as possibly adding the framework to its academic program in the future, enabling its students to quickly prototype and test their project ideas.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5e5bd6a175d7b20a3421f0de_1_ZL78FX8wGZKDzfYG4GvmhQ.jpg)

The Swiss Blockchain Institute opened its doors back in October 2019. As a training institution entirely dedicated to blockchain, its main objective is to close the current gap between the offer and demand of blockchain professionals. As its founder Matthieu Collas states, today for every trained blockchain development engineer on the marketplace there are 14 recruitment requests from companies.

The Institute trains its students on various programming languages like Ethereum, Solidity, Hyperledger, Corda, Tezos and others. In the long term, it also aims to integrate Proxeus to its training offering: “Proxeus is often compared to WordPress as it allows to simplify the creation of applications that interact with the blockchain. Making students familiar with the framework will give them precious new skills as they will be empowered to quickly prototype new products and services,” says Collas.

Following completion of a program, participants receive a certificate in accordance with the selected training. “Making our credentials immutable and easily verifiable is a natural step for the Institute and it provides an extra layer of security for both students and employers,” says Collas. Such certificates are tamper-proof which makes fraud impossible. Apart from using Proxeus to issue students certificates, the Institute is also looking for other use cases where the framework could enhance internal and external processes.

Proxeus workflows: a strong backbone
====================================

January 22, 2020

In past articles we explored Proxeus forms, smart templates and the document service. Proxeus workflows is where all elements come together — let’s take a look how they constitute the backbone of every Proxeus application by defining the process logic and connecting to various actions and input sources.

**What is a Proxeus workflow?**
-------------------------------

A Proxeus workflow is a series of sequential steps that are carried out based on user-defined rules or conditions in order to execute a business process. Workflows enable Proxeus users to [digitize their know-how](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-wrap-your-know-how-digitally-a99150875ffe) and to make it available to third parties, for free or for a fee paid in XES.
