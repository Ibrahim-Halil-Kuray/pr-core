_We are proud to announce that we have reached an important milestone: the Proxeus software has reached v1.1 and has been open sourced under a GNU GPLv3 license. Set up your own Proxeus instance and create your first application today!_

## ABOUT PROXEUS

Just like Wordpress empowered companies and enthusiasts to create websites without starting from a blank page at the beginning of the Internet, Proxeus aims to make blockchain technology more accessible by shortening the time necessary to create and test document-oriented use cases. The Proxeus software is a powerful workflow engine, allowing users without specific programming skills to digitize complex document templates, connect them to a business logic and make them available to third-parties on a web-based portal — for free or for a fee.

Since the [v1 release](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-v1-0-32144b628349) in September, several improvements have been made to implement the community feedback, as well as the recommendations received through a series of product, technical, legal and security audit rounds. The application comes with a better solution to implement custom nodes and a series of [UI improvements](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-design-update-have-a-look-at-our-improved-user-interface-d92af28b1ee9).

**SET UP PROXEUS**

**Step 1:** To install and run your own instance of Proxeus, follow the instructions published on [doc.proxeus.com](http://doc.proxeus.com/#/). Always make sure that you always pull Docker images from the official \`proxeus\` DockerHub repository and that you are using the latest version.

**Step 2:** Once your Proxeus platform is up and running, head over to the [configuration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3B1oNY6lOv8Q_AvbKhwlySrS6qTiRl3raPLV6OXr7w/edit) in the handbook and follow the configuration steps. After completing the power up, you can log in with your newly created root user account. We recommend you always start by connecting to the Ropsten testnet and test your applications extensively.

**Step 3:** Deploy your own Proxeus smart contract following the instructions you will find in the documentation, or if you prefer, use our demo contract.

_If you are only interested to give Proxeus a quick try, we are running_ [_a demo platform_](https://demo.proxeus.com/) _connected to the Ropsten testnet, which you can use to get familiar with Proxeus instead of deploying your own instance. Please be aware that this platform is only available for demo purposes and the data is therefore being wiped on a regular basis: make sure to check the schedule published on the Proxeus website in order to avoid losing your work._

**CREATE YOUR FIRST APPLICATION**

Now that you have successfully installed and configured your Proxeus platform, you can start creating your first application. A minimal workflow comprises one template and a form to gather the data to be inserted into the document.

There are vast possibilities to use Proxeus that require zero programming. Proxeus “out of the box” is a powerful document automation platform with blockchain capabilities. You can customize the platform to your liking: place your own logo, change any text label or add multi-language support. You can configure workflows with intuitive, dynamic user forms by using the drag & drop editors.

Once your first workflow is ready, you can decide to keep it for yourself or to make it available to third-parties. For that go to the workflow workspace, set a price (in XES tokens) and click on the publish button: your workflow will become accessible to other users and you will receive a fee in XES tokens each time a workflow execution is purchased.

**EXTEND PROXEUS**

External nodes is an extension system allowing technical users to add functionality to their workflows without touching the Proxeus Core application. You can install extensions provided by the community without writing any code — or decide to create your own. If you are running your own software product, you could for example build an external node allowing Proxeus platform Operators to give their users direct access to your product. Learn more about external nodes on the [developers page](https://www.proxeus.com/developers).

**ACCESS AND MODIFY THE OPEN SOURCE CODE**

Users with software development skills have even more comprehensive ways to customize the software. Be it for your own needs or as a contributor to the Proxeus open source community, you can deep dive into the application’s inner workings.

Proxeus is completely open source and the full code and documentation for all of the elements of the Proxeus framework has been released on the [official Proxeus GitHub account](https://github.com/ProxeusApp) repositories. where you will find:

*   Proxeus Core — the main application for creating and running workflows
*   Document Service — the service that renders templates into PDFs and DOCX
*   ProxeusFS — an example Proxeus smart contract

**GET INSPIRED**

Prior to this release, we developed several prototypes showing how the framework can be used to incorporate new businesses, issue course certificates, create donation receipts, certify assets, track shipments or make anti-doping processes more secure — those examples are detailed on a dedicated section of the [website](http://www.proxeus.com/discover). We also created two additional application examples as additional inspiration to the community and demonstrate how workflows can be monetized using XES: a tax reporting tool for crypto assets and a proof of prior existence workflow. Both come with full code and documentation and are deployed on the demo platform.

**A WORD OF CAUTION**

The Proxeus software has undergone a series of audits before its open source release. Despite all precautions, users should not postulate that all security-relevant issues have been identified. In fact, the assumption must be made that there will be more bugs. You are using the Proxeus software or any code from its GitHub repositories at your own risk. If you decide to use the Proxeus software, do your own research and be sure to have read and understood the documentation beforehand. You are encouraged to thoroughly inspect the code that you will run before attempting to do anything.

**BECOME A CONTRIBUTOR**

The open source community is a huge worldwide movement with countless brilliant minds, and we are convinced that external contributors can have an immense impact on the Proxeus software going forward: some will hunt bugs and contribute to increase the security for everyone. Others will make suggestions for improvements or for whole new features. Business-minded people will come up with new use cases and concepts for industry-specific applications. Creative minds will contribute to further improve the user interface and to upgrade the user experience. Open source communities are incredibly resourceful — passion for good software, curiosity for new ideas and the joy of achieving something together are great motivators.

How about you? If you feel that you could contribute something and want to put your own mark on the project, the Proxeus community will be more than happy to welcome you.

Every Ending is a new Beginning
===============================

June 9, 2020

With the open sourcing of Proxeus, Proxeus Anstalt has achieved the mission it was entrusted with by the token holder community and will be winded down, while Proxeus will be becoming a community-run project.

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d5ada771e1398913827a622/5edfb6fc58665539b2ee7269_1_63NaTJucm9sATOSpX2JQ9Q.jpg)

_In September 2019, we announced the delivery of Proxeus v1 offering anyone the possibility to install and run an instance of Proxeus making transactions on livenet. Since then, several improvements have been made to implement recommendations received through a series of functional and technical audit rounds, and integrate community feedback. Today, Proxeus Anstalt has published v1.1 of the Proxeus framework as open source software. With this step, Proxeus Anstalt has achieved the mission it was entrusted with by the token holder community and will be winded down, while Proxeus will be becoming a community-run project._

**Why Proxeus?**

By enabling trust to be established algorithmically without a need for the counterparties of a business transaction to know each other, blockchain technology creates new framework conditions allowing innovative business models to emerge. Yet blockchain is largely uncharted territory and the technological and financial barriers to create those new models are still high. Just like Wordpress empowered companies and enthusiasts to create websites without starting from a blank page at the beginning of the Internet, the Proxeus project was started to make blockchain technology more accessible and shorten the time necessary to create and test document-oriented blockchain use cases. In essence, the framework can be seen as a bridge connecting two worlds and allowing on the one hand individuals and businesses to digitize traditional processes and register information on a blockchain, and on the other one to make blockchain activity visible by generating human-readable documents.

**From vision to product**

Following a successful Token Generating Event and as per the project whitepaper, Proxeus appointed BlockFactory AG, a software development company based in Zug, Switzerland, to develop a software solution corresponding to the requirements outlined in the Proxeus whitepaper document. BlockFactory set out to tackle this objective by scoping the project alongside the following main pillars and principles:

**Software architecture**: Proxeus should have a strong foundation to allow community projects to scale. The key technology choices were made in anticipation of the future needs. The product architecture was analyzed and improved with a special focus on the compatibility of Proxeus with external systems, thereby maximizing the chances of adoption of the product by the developer community.

**User needs and requirements**: What functionality does the community expect? In order to put the whitepaper ideas into context and receive direct user feedback at different steps along the way, BlockFactory worked with external partners to develop a series of projects using the Proxeus technology stack in various contexts. The engineering team made the Proxeus code available in the context of events such as hackathons, allowing to gather input from developers with various backgrounds, and calls for community feedback were launched upon reaching key milestones.

**Usability**: Do the features and functions support the Proxeus mission to make blockchain more easily accessible? Poor user experience is currently one of the key reasons for the lack of adoption of blockchain technology by the wider public. Usability was a key principle in the product decisions made along the way and led us to deliver Proxeus as a hosted platform allowing its operators to make the best of two worlds — combining decentralized identities, payments and other blockchain capabilities with the advantages of operating a system in a server or cloud environment. This setup reduces adoption barriers and removes distribution challenges.

Over the past two years, BlockFactory worked with industry partners on projects using the Proxeus technology stack in various contexts: from [speeding up the incorporation of Swiss companies](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-helps-speeding-up-swiss-business-incorporations-dd0eed421576) to [tokenizing a supercar](https://medium.com/proxeus/blockchain-enables-investing-in-classic-cars-for-everybody-not-just-millionaires-5e9dec740aee), demonstrating a [track-and-trace solution](https://medium.com/proxeus/proxeus-technology-enables-shipment-tracking-system-based-on-iota-91484c503978) for the logistics space, [making university diplomas tamper-proof](/blog-posts/swiss-university-certificates-turn-tamper-proof-thanks-to-blockchain) or [improving anti-doping processes](/blog-posts/bringing-blockchain-to-the-anti-doping-world). This inflow of requirements based on concrete user needs constituted an important help for concretizing the architecture, scope and functionalities of the solution. Several of those initiatives also received international recognition and media coverage, creating global awareness for Proxeus and inspiring community members to prototype and test their own ideas.

In addition to community validation, the solution delivered today as open-source software has been audited by a series of independent product, technical, legal and security experts, and several rounds of improvements took place to implement their recommendations. The final feedback we received from Old School GmbH, a specialised consultancy based in Crypto Valley who reviewed the product functionality, made us very proud: according to its founder Bernd Lapp, “the Proxeus software was not only built with all key functionality originally promised, it also includes a series of useful additions and the product stands out as very intuitive and visually attractive. Proxeus contributes to the credibility of the blockchain space as a whole and we hope to see more projects release a valuable product in the future.”

**What comes next: towards a decentralized governance**

Proxeus was designed as a community initiative from the start and as the software is being open sourced, its further development will be driven by its users. A new not-for-profit body aiming to maintain and develop the Proxeus software going forward — Proxeus Association — was recently created by a group of trusted and committed community members. Proxeus Association aims to set up a decentralized governance structure enabling the global stakeholder community to take influence on future developments, and will take over the management of all communication channels (social media, blog, website) from this point on.

**Thank you**

Proxeus was set up with a mission to enable anyone to create document-centered applications leveraging the blockchain. Moving from a visionary whitepaper to a concrete software product was a long road consisting of many challenges and breakthroughs. We faced strong headwinds and battled our way through deep crypto winter. We had to revise our assumptions several times along the way and we inevitably made a few wrong decisions, but setbacks have also made us stronger: we had a lot of amazing successes and the team showed extraordinary dedication to bring the project to completion.

We would like to make a special thank you to our unique community, whose members have shown overwhelming support for the project from the start and shared their feedback and enthusiasm during good and difficult times alike. It’s been fascinating to watch the Proxeus project gradually take its own dynamic, covering use cases going even beyond the possibilities that we had in mind when the project started. It is still early days and the Proxeus ecosystem has only started to grow. As the code is handed over to the community, this toolbox will serve a growing number of individuals and organizations interested to explore the possibilities offered at the intersection of document workflows and decentralized ledgers.

Thank you also to our partners, in particular to the BlockFactory team, who oversaw the technical aspects of the project and worked extremely hard to build the product and has seen things to the very end. Many of the project members will continue supporting Proxeus in various roles after a much-needed break and we can’t wait to see what new ideas will come to life over the coming years. The journey to large-scale blockchain adoption is still a long one and we are the first to recognize that it is only beginning, but with the Proxeus v1.1 release, we just contributed our part towards this vision.
